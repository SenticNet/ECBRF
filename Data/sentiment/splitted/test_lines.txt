	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	positive
	Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.	negative
	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	positive
	Overpriced for what you are getting.	negative
	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	positive
	Even the squibs look awful.  	negative
	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	positive
	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	negative
	GO AND SEE IT!  	positive
	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	negative
	The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.	positive
	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	negative
	Owner's are really great people.!	positive
	It was pretty gross!	negative
	Excellent performance.  	positive
	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	negative
	Excellent hands free tool.	positive
	Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	negative
	The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	positive
	Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	negative
	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	positive
	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!	negative
	I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	positive
	I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.	negative
	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.	positive
	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	negative
	Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.	positive
	Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.	negative
	I especially love the long battery life.	positive
	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	negative
	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	positive
	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	negative
	It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  	positive
	Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.	negative
	Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !	positive
	horrible, had to switch 3 times.	negative
	The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	positive
	The results, well, are a shame.  	negative
	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	positive
	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	negative
	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	positive
	A Disappointment.	negative
	Fantastic food!	positive
	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	negative
	I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	positive
	Hated it.  	negative
	Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended	positive
	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	negative
	Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	positive
	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	negative
	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	positive
	The warm beer didn't help.	negative
	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	positive
	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	negative
	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	positive
	The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	negative
	It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	positive
	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	negative
	I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	positive
	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	negative
	And service was super friendly.	positive
	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.	negative
	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	positive
	I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	negative
	The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	positive
	I Was Hoping for More.	negative
	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	positive
	Battery lasts only a few hours.	negative
	The film gives meaning to the phrase, "Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  	positive
	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	negative
	The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	positive
	It was packed!!	negative
	Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	positive
	That was done in the second movie.  	negative
	Definitely a bargain.	positive
	It was way over fried.	negative
	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	positive
	It also had a new problem.	negative
	THey are so cool!	positive
	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.	negative
	You won't forget this movie!  	positive
	Hell no will I go back	negative
	I'll definitely be in soon again.	positive
	I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.	negative
	Good prices.	positive
	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	negative
	It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	positive
	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	negative
	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	positive
	Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	negative
	This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	positive
	They work about 2 weeks then break.	negative
	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	positive
	like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	negative
	You wont regret it!  	positive
	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	negative
	Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.	positive
	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	negative
	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	positive
	Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	negative
	The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	positive
	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	negative
	Definitely worth checking out.  	positive
	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	negative
	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	positive
	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	negative
	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	positive
	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	negative
	These were so good we ordered them twice.	positive
	not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	negative
	This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	positive
	Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	negative
	Incredible!.	positive
	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	negative
	The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	positive
	REALLY UGLY.	negative
	I highly recommend this device to everyone!	positive
	Spend your money elsewhere.	negative
	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	positive
	The movie is terribly boring in places.  	negative
	10 out of 10 stars.  	positive
	There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  	negative
	It deserves strong love.  	positive
	Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.	negative
	Those phones are working just fine now.	positive
	Total brunch fail.	negative
	They have great dinners.	positive
	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	negative
	Very friendly staff.	positive
	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	negative
	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	positive
	The ambiance isn't much better.	negative
	This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  	positive
	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	negative
	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	positive
	Horrible, horrible protector.	negative
	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	positive
	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	negative
	My sister has one also and she loves it.	positive
	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	negative
	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	positive
	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	negative
	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	positive
	Unfortunately, it was not good.	negative
	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	positive
	I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	negative
	Excellent short film.  	positive
	This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	negative
	The food came out at a good pace.	positive
	I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.	negative
	It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	positive
	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	negative
	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	positive
	The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  	negative
	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	positive
	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	negative
	So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	positive
	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	negative
	Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	positive
	And the drinks are WEAK, people!	negative
	This is an extraordinary film.  	positive
	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	negative
	I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	positive
	the phone was unusable and was not new.	negative
	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	positive
	Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	negative
	but it is great, i would really recommend it	positive
	Poor product.	negative
	The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	positive
	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	negative
	Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	positive
	But then they came back cold.	negative
	It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	positive
	And it was way to expensive.	negative
	By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	positive
	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	negative
	The noise shield is incrediable.	positive
	Avoid at any and all costs.  	negative
	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	positive
	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	negative
	But I thought his acting was skilled.  	positive
	Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	negative
	Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	positive
	Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	negative
	I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .	positive
	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	negative
	Fantastic earphones.	positive
	And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	negative
	It has kept up very well.	positive
	There is nothing authentic about this place.	negative
	It looks very nice.	positive
	Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  	negative
	Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	positive
	I would have given no star if I was able.	negative
	These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	positive
	Bad Choice.	negative
	Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	positive
	Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	negative
	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	positive
	Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	negative
	I had strawberry tea, which was good.	positive
	It just blew.  	negative
	Krussel Always good.	positive
	I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	negative
	Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	positive
	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	negative
	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	positive
	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	negative
	The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	positive
	Avoid at ALL costs!  	negative
	I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.	positive
	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	negative
	I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	positive
	End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	negative
	I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).	positive
	Don't buy this product.	negative
	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	positive
	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.	negative
	The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	positive
	Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	negative
	Good transmit audio.	positive
	It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	negative
	Battery charge-life is quite long.	positive
	Thoroughly disappointed!	negative
	Brilliance indeed.  	positive
	The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  	negative
	Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	positive
	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	negative
	Very good quality though	positive
	I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	negative
	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	positive
	It was just too horrible.  	negative
	you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	positive
	So bad...well...it's just bad.  	negative
	That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	positive
	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	negative
	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	positive
	What a waste of time!	negative
	Extremely Tasty!	positive
	We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	negative
	Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	positive
	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	negative
	Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	positive
	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	negative
	This device is great in several situations:1.)	positive
	Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.	negative
	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	positive
	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	negative
	A film not easily forgotten.  	positive
	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	negative
	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	positive
	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.	negative
	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  	positive
	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	negative
	I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.	positive
	My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	negative
	10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	positive
	I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.	negative
	I did not expect this to be so good!	positive
	Warning - Stay away.	negative
	The shrimp tender and moist.	positive
	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	negative
	It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	positive
	I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	negative
	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	positive
	The lead man is charisma-free.  	negative
	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	positive
	During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.	negative
	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	positive
	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	negative
	Ray Charles is legendary.  	positive
	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	negative
	Nice, spicy and tender.	positive
	Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  	negative
	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	positive
	I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	negative
	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	positive
	Also the story and acting were weak.  	negative
	The atmosphere here is fun.	positive
	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	negative
	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	positive
	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	negative
	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	positive
	I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	negative
	I would recommend it.	positive
	How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	negative
	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	positive
	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	negative
	I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.	positive
	Avoid, avoid, avoid!  	negative
	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	positive
	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	negative
	I LOVED it!	positive
	If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  	negative
	Interesting decor.	positive
	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	negative
	Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	positive
	If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	negative
	That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	positive
	It felt too light and "tinny.".	negative
	The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	positive
	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	negative
	This fixes all the problems.	positive
	-My order was not correct.	negative
	Great choice!	positive
	The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	negative
	2 thumbs up to this seller	positive
	We won't be going back.	negative
	Worked perfectly!	positive
	Why was this film made?  	negative
	Very pleased with this headset.	positive
	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	negative
	This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.	positive
	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	negative
	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	positive
	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	negative
	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	positive
	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	negative
	Great software for Motorolas.	positive
	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	negative
	It was also the right balance of war and love.  	positive
	I won't be back.	negative
	Very easy to use.	positive
	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	negative
	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	positive
	Worst Thai ever.	negative
	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	positive
	Avoid at all costs.  	negative
	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	positive
	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	negative
	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	positive
	I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	negative
	Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	positive
	I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!	negative
	Restored my phone to like new performance.	positive
	camera color balance is AWFUL.	negative
	Great case and price!	positive
	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	negative
	Excellent wallet type phone case.	positive
	WORST PHONE EVER.	negative
	I received it quickly and it works great!!	positive
	This place is horrible and way overpriced.	negative
	I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	positive
	The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	negative
	Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..	positive
	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	negative
	This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	positive
	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	negative
	This is such a fun and funny movie.  	positive
	One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	negative
	On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	positive
	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	negative
	This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.	positive
	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.	negative
	You can't beat the price on these.	positive
	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.	negative
	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	positive
	Nothing new there.  	negative
	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	positive
	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	negative
	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	positive
	Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	negative
	The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	positive
	Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	negative
	It was absolutely amazing.	positive
	But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  	negative
	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	positive
	I probably won't be back, to be honest.	negative
	Brilliant!  	positive
	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	negative
	The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	positive
	I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  	negative
	Comfort for our whole family.	positive
	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	negative
	Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	positive
	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	negative
	Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	positive
	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	negative
	This battery is an excellent bargain!	positive
	This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.	negative
	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	positive
	My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	negative
	Great Product.	positive
	After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.	negative
	Works great.	positive
	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	negative
	This place is amazing!	positive
	It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	negative
	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	positive
	A bit predictable.  	negative
	They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	positive
	I only hear garbage for audio.	negative
	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	positive
	It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	negative
	I love all the features and form factor.	positive
	Worst Customer Service Ever.	negative
	It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	positive
	Woa, talk about awful.  	negative
	Never had anything to complain about here.	positive
	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.	negative
	So absolutley fantastic.	positive
	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	negative
	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	positive
	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	negative
	For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	positive
	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	negative
	WELL IM SATISFIED.	positive
	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	negative
	I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.	positive
	The buttons for on and off are bad.	negative
	Product is exactly as described.	positive
	Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  	negative
	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	positive
	Everything stinks.  	negative
	The price is reasonable and the service is great.	positive
	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	negative
	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	positive
	Then, there's the plot holes.  	negative
	There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	positive
	Please dont waste your money.	negative
	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	positive
	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	negative
	The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.	positive
	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	negative
	The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	positive
	Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	negative
	Great Phone.	positive
	Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  	negative
	" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	positive
	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	negative
	I am also very happy with the price.	positive
	Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	negative
	Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	positive
	But it's just not funny.  	negative
	Excellent Phone.	positive
	What did bother me, was the slow service.	negative
	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	positive
	But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	negative
	See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	positive
	Piece of trash.	negative
	This PDA rocks.	positive
	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	negative
	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	positive
	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	negative
	Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	positive
	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	negative
	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	positive
	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	negative
	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	positive
	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	negative

	useless phone, simply deaf.	negative

	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	negative
	Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	positive
	I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	negative
	Good food , good service .	positive
	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.	negative
	Both great!	positive
	Mediocre food.	negative
	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	positive
	Improper description.... I had to return it.	negative
	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	positive
	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.	negative
	steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  	positive
	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	negative
	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	positive
	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	negative
	This movie is so awesome!  	positive
	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	negative
	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	positive
	There were too many close ups.  	negative
	The mic is great.	positive
	There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	negative
	There are some generally great things in it.  	positive
	I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.	negative
	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	positive
	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	negative
	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	positive
	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	negative

	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	negative
	This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	positive
	People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.	negative
	I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.	positive
	Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  	negative
	They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	positive
	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	negative
	Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	positive
	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	negative
	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	positive
	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	negative
	They really want to make your experience a good one.	positive
	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	negative
	Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.	positive
	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	negative
	The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	positive
	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	negative
	Everything was perfect the night we were in.	positive
	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	negative
