	The replacement died in a few weeks.	negative
	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	positive
	For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	negative

	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	positive
	It doesn't make you look cool.	negative
	Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	positive
	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	negative
	This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	positive
	To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	negative

	The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	positive
	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	negative

	Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	positive
	Spend your money and time some place else.	negative
	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	positive

	I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	negative
	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	positive
	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	negative
	The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	positive
	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	negative
	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	positive
	You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	negative
	This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  	positive
	20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	negative

	Very happy with this product.	positive
	The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	negative
	Great product, fast shipping!.	positive
	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	negative

	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	positive
	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	negative
	The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	positive
	Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.	negative

	It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  	negative

	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	positive
	Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	negative
	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	positive

	Good price.	positive

	Will be back again!	positive
	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	negative
	The rest of the cast also play well.  	positive
	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	negative
	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	positive
	Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	negative
	It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	positive
	but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	negative
	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	positive
	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	negative
	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	positive
	Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	negative
	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	positive

	As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	positive
	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.	negative

	you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.	negative
	There is a brilliant twist ending.  	positive
	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	negative
	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	positive
	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	negative
	good item, low price.	positive
	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	negative
	Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	positive

	I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	negative
	Lange had become a great actress.  	positive
	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	negative
	This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	positive
	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	negative
	***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	positive
	there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	negative

	Babie Bop is very cute.  	positive
	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	negative

	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	negative
	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	positive
	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	negative
	The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	positive
	The only downside is the service.	negative
	The music in the film is really nice too.  	positive
	My rating: just 3 out of 10.  	negative
	Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	positive
	Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	negative
	Reasonably priced also!	positive
	An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	negative
	Awesome service and food.	positive
	This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.	negative
	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	positive
	Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  	negative
	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	positive
	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	negative
	Service is friendly and inviting.	positive
	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	negative
	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	positive

	Great food.	positive
	Very Dissapointing Performance.	negative
	I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	positive
	Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	negative
	This is a great deal.	positive
	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	negative
	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	positive
	And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	negative
	They have a really nice atmosphere.	positive
	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!	negative
	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	positive
	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	negative
	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	positive
	NOT WHAT I WANTED.	negative
	Great brunch spot.	positive

	Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	negative
	It was quite comfortable in the ear.	positive
	disappointing.	negative
	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	positive
	In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	negative
	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	positive
	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	negative
	I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	positive

	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	positive
	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.	negative
	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	positive
	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	negative
	Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	positive
	I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good	negative
	Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	positive
	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.	negative
	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	positive
	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	negative
	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	positive
	Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	negative
	I really enjoyed Crema CafÃ© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	positive
	I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	negative
	Has been working great.	positive
	Rating: 1 out of 10.  	negative
	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	positive
	Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	negative
	Great Pizza and Salads!	positive
	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	negative
	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	positive
	And none of the tones is acceptable.	negative
	This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	positive
	However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.	negative
	This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.	positive
	The service was poor and thats being nice.	negative
	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	positive
	This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  	negative
	Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	positive
	I would not recommend this place.	negative
	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.	positive
	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	negative
	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	positive
	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	negative
	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	positive
	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	negative
	I was seated immediately.	positive
	Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  	negative
	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	positive
	Not recommended.  	negative
	I'm still infatuated with this phone.	positive
	After two I felt disgusting.	negative
	I love this bluetooth!	positive
	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.	negative
	Portable and it works.	positive
	Painful on the ear.	negative
	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	positive
	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	negative
	This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	positive
	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	negative
	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	positive
	It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	negative
	Meredith M was better than all right.  	positive
	Very disappointing!!!	negative
	nice leather.	positive
	Phone falls out easily.	negative
	DELICIOUS!!	positive
	I mean this in a terrible way.  	negative
	This is a stunning movie.  	positive
	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	negative
	Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	positive
	I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  	negative
	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	positive
	Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	negative
	It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  	positive
	My gyro was basically lettuce only.	negative
	Nice headphones for the price and they work great!	positive
	Poor Talk Time Performance.	negative
	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	positive
	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	negative
	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	positive
	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	negative
	And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	positive
	The lighting is awful.  	negative
	The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.	positive
	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros	negative
	I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	positive
	Filmiing was less expansive.  	negative
	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	positive
	Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	negative
	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	positive
	I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.	negative
	The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	positive
	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	negative
	So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	positive
	I'm trying to return it for a refund.	negative
	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	positive
	Not recommended.  	negative
	Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	positive
	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	negative
	Keep up the good work Amazon!!	positive
	Of course, the acting is blah.  	negative
	A great film by a great director.  	positive
	All in all, a great disappointment.  	negative
	It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	positive
	THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  	negative
	The food was excellent and service was very good.	positive
	Chinese Forgeries Abound!.	negative
	This is just a great movie.  	positive
	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	negative
	Great service and food.	positive
	sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	negative
	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	positive
	And it was boring.  	negative
	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	positive
	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	negative
	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	positive
	I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	negative
	Nice case, feels good in your hands.	positive
	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	negative
	Better than expected.	positive
	Last time buying from you.	negative
	It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	positive
	For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.	negative
	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	positive
	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	negative
	As for the service, I thought it was good.	positive
	I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.	negative
	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	positive
	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	negative
	This is a beautiful phone.	positive
	Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  	negative
	Better than you'd expect.	positive
	Either way, it sucks.  	negative
	If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	positive
	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.	negative
	This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	positive
	I want my money back.	negative
	Great price, too!	positive
	I took back my money and got outta there.	negative
	I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  	positive
	Glad I didn't pay to see it.  	negative
	This is a great phone!.	positive
	Awful.  	negative
	Plan on ordering from them again and again.	positive
	This one is simply a disappointment.	negative
	I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  	positive
	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.	negative
	I advise you to look out for it.  	positive
	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	negative
	It definitely was not as good as my S11.	positive
	Waste of money.	negative
	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	positive
	What a big waste of time.	negative
	I *heart* this place.	positive
	Sauce was tasteless.	negative
	Overall, I like there food and the service.	positive
	I don't like this Nokia either.	negative
	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	positive
	Earbud piece breaks easily.	negative
	One of my favorite purchases ever.	positive
	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	negative
	I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.	positive
	Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	negative
	2 Thumbs Up!!	positive
	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	negative
	I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.	positive
	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	negative
	Up there with the best of Melville.  	positive
	It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	negative
	IT'S REALLY EASY.	positive
	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	negative
	The bartender was also nice.	positive
	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	negative
	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	positive
	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	negative
	The portion was huge!	positive
	Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	negative
	Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	positive
	I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	negative
	" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	positive
	Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	negative
	I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	positive
	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	negative
	I liked this movie way too much.  	positive
	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	negative
	Nice Sound.	positive
	I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.	negative
	Go watch it!  	positive
	In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	negative
	The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	positive
	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	negative
	This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	positive
	Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	negative
	Excellent dual-purpose headset.	positive
	Food quality has been horrible.	negative
	Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.	positive
	This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	negative
	I love this place.	positive
	It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  	negative
	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	positive
	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	negative
	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	positive
	very tough and very short on flavor!	negative
	The ambiance was incredible.	positive
	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	negative
	Waitress was sweet and funny.	positive
	Not a good bargain.	negative
	Perfect for the PS3.	positive
	So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	negative
	Very very fun chef.	positive
	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	negative
	It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	positive
	I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	negative
	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	positive
	Food was really boring.	negative
	great headset, very impressed - H500.	positive
	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	negative
	I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	positive
	However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.	negative
	great...no problems at all!.	positive
	Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  	negative
	10/10  	positive
	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	negative
	Love this product.	positive
	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	negative
	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	positive
	Not even good for camp value!  	negative
	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	positive
	This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	negative
	Really pleased with this product so far.	positive
	When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.	negative
	The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	positive
	But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	negative
	I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	positive
	Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.	negative
	But this movie really got to me.  	positive
	The food was terrible.	negative
	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	positive
	I've had better atmosphere.	negative
	There is a lot of beautiful places.  	positive
	It didn't charge for me.	negative
	Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	positive
	The kids play area is NASTY!	negative
	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.	positive
	I will not be eating there again.	negative
	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	positive
	But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	negative
	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	positive
	The dialogue sucked.  	negative
	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	positive
	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	negative
	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	positive
	Battery has no life.	negative
	Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	positive
	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	negative
	I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	positive
	Nothing at all to recommend.  	negative
	Linked to my phone without effort.	positive
	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	negative
	definitely will come back here again.	positive
	I was not happy with this item.	negative
	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	positive
	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	negative
	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	positive
	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	negative
	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	positive
	Con: spotty service.	negative
	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	positive
	If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	negative
	The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	positive
	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	negative
	An excellent performance from Ms.  	positive
	I had to purchase a different case.	negative
	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	positive
	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	negative
	This is actually a very smart movie.  	positive
	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	negative
	The food is good.	positive
	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	negative
	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	positive
	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	negative
	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	positive
	I'd like to return it.	negative
	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	positive
	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	negative
	Cant say enough good things about this place.	positive
	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	negative
	She carries the movie well.  	positive
	Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!	negative
	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	positive
	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	negative
	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	positive
	" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  	negative
	He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	positive
	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	negative
	10/10  	positive
	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	negative
	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	positive
	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	negative
	Good show, Samsung.	positive
	The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	negative
	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	positive
	) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  	negative
	The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	positive
	Would not recommend to others.	negative
	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	positive
	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	negative
	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	positive
	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.	negative
	The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	positive
	You can find better movies at youtube.  	negative
	Very good phone.	positive
	It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	negative
	Jawbone Era is awesome too!	positive
	VERY DISAPPOINTED.	negative
	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	positive
	Disappointing experience.	negative
	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.	positive

	We are so glad we found this place.	positive
	I'm super pissd.	negative
	I got it because it was so small and adorable.	positive
	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	negative
	this place is good.	positive
	I never walked out of a movie faster.  	negative
	This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	positive

	Never going back.	negative
	Overall, I like this place a lot.	positive
	The battery life is highly unacceptable.	negative

	Excellent sound quality.	positive
	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	negative
	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	positive

	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	positive
	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	negative
	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	positive
	Does not fit.	negative
	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	positive
	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	negative
	If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	positive
	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	negative
	Highly recommended A+  	positive
	This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	negative
	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	positive
	I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	negative
	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	positive
	I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	negative
	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	positive
	Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  	negative
	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	positive
	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	negative
	Love This Phone.	positive
	dont go here.	negative
	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	positive
	I hate movies like that.  	negative
	A good time!	positive
	The food wasn't good.	negative
	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	positive
	The acting sucked.  	negative
	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	positive
	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement	negative
	A standout scene.  	positive
	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)	negative
	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	positive
	Returned 8 hours later.	negative
	This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	positive
	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	negative
	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	positive
	As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	negative
	This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	positive
	Soyo technology sucks.	negative
	I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	positive
	Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	negative
	Always a pleasure dealing with him.	positive
	After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.	negative
	I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	positive
	The item received was Counterfeit.	negative
	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	positive
	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	negative
	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	positive
	There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	negative
	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	positive
	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	negative
	Excellent product for the price.	positive
	This place deserves no stars.	negative
	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	positive
	However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	negative
	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	positive
	So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  	negative
	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	positive
	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	negative
	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	positive
	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	negative
	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	positive
	The story line is totally predictable.  	negative
	I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	positive
	The selection of food was not the best.	negative
	Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	positive
	This place should honestly be blown up.	negative
	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.	positive
	first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	negative
	I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	positive
	The live music on Fridays totally blows.	negative
	I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	positive
	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	negative
	If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	positive
	But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	negative
	The waitresses are very friendly.	positive
	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	negative
	The delivery was on time.	positive
	Camerawork - again, bad.  	negative
	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	positive
	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	negative
	The food is very good for your typical bar food.	positive
	This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	negative
	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	positive
	THAT one didn't work either.	negative
	The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	positive
	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	negative
	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	positive
	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	negative
	An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	positive
	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	negative
	The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	positive
	Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	negative
	Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	positive
	stay away from this store, be careful.	negative
	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	positive
	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	negative
	Voice recognition is tremendous!	positive
	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	negative
	You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."	positive
	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	negative
	It is worth the drive.	positive
	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	negative
	I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	positive
	They do not care about the consumer one bit.	negative
	Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.	positive
	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	negative
	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	positive
	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	negative
	A pretty good product.	positive
	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	negative
	Raw and sublimely moving.  	positive
	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	negative
	The food, amazing.	positive
	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	negative
	Great for the jawbone.	positive
	Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	negative
	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	positive
	I would not recommend this place.	negative
	Crisp and Clear.	positive
	All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	negative
	This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	positive
	Long, whiny and pointless.  	negative
	It does everything the description said it would.	positive
	Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	negative
	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	positive
	Too politically correct.  	negative
	I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.	positive
	As for the "mains," also uninspired.	negative
	Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	positive
	But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.	negative
	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	positive
	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	negative
	Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	positive
	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.	negative
	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	positive
	I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	negative
	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	positive
	I also didn't like the "on" button, it felt like it would crack with use.	negative
	This one works and was priced right.	positive
	The service was a bit lacking.	negative
	I had a pretty satifying experience.	positive
	The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  	negative
	But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.	positive
	I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	negative
	Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	positive
	The service was terrible though.	negative
	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	positive
	Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	negative
	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	positive
	If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.	negative
	Works fine.	positive
	Poor Reliability.	negative
	They know how to make them here.	positive
	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	negative
	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	positive
	I never come again.	negative
	I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  	positive
	Really bad.  	negative
	Battery life is real good.	positive
	I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	negative
	Eclectic selection.	positive
	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	negative
	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	positive
	This is infuriating.	negative
	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	positive
	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	negative
	Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	positive
	None of it works, just don't buy it.	negative
	I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	positive
	Bad Reception.	negative
	Works great!.	positive
	Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	negative
	This is a great little item.	positive
	But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	negative
	Great sound and service.	positive
	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	negative
	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	positive
	The story line is just awful!  	negative
	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	positive
	I wasn't the least bit interested.  	negative
	!I definitly recommend!!	positive
	Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	negative
	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	positive
	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	negative
	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	positive
	Probably not in a hurry to go back.	negative
	Magical Help.	positive
	the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	negative
	For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	positive
	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	negative
	I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	positive
	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	negative
	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.	positive
	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	negative
	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	positive
	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	negative
	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	positive
	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	negative
	Great Pocket PC / phone combination.	positive
	I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.	negative
	The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	positive
	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	negative
	Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	positive
	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	negative
	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	positive
	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	negative
	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	positive
	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	negative
	The staff was very attentive.	positive
	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	negative
	This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	positive
	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	negative
	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	positive
	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	negative
	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.	positive
	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	negative
	I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	positive
	This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	negative
	cool phone.	positive
	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	negative
	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	positive
	This was like the final blow!	negative
	We loved the biscuits!!!	positive
	I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	negative
	As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	positive
	On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	negative
	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	positive
	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	negative
	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	positive
	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	negative
	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	positive
	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	negative
	Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	positive
	This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  	negative
	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	positive
	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	negative
	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	positive
	The worst one of the series.  	negative
	A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	positive
	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	negative
	Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	positive
	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.	negative
	Food arrived quickly!	positive
	Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  	negative
	This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	positive
	I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  	negative
	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.	positive
	Doesn't Work.	negative
	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	positive
	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	negative
	My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	positive
	I was VERY disappointed!!	negative
	They were golden-crispy and delicious.	positive
	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	negative
	It is very comfortable on the ear.	positive
	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	negative
	The Macarons here are insanely good.	positive
	The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	negative
	Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	positive
	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	negative
	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	positive
	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	negative
	The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  	positive
	Never again will I be dining at this place!	negative
	The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	positive
	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	negative
	Exactly what I wanted.	positive
	The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	negative
	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	positive
	Item Does Not Match Picture.	negative
	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	positive
	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	negative
	However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	positive
	Highly unrecommended.  	negative
	Great for iPODs too.	positive
	Very poor service.	negative
	The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	positive
	It is shameful.  	negative
	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	positive
	Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	negative
	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	positive
	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	negative
	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	positive
	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.	negative
	It really created a unique feeling though.  	positive
	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	negative
	The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	positive
	And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	negative
	Works well.	positive
	As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	negative
	We loved the place.	positive
	The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	negative
	These are fabulous!	positive
	Doesn't hold charge.	negative
	- the food is rich so order accordingly.	positive
	Everything about it is just bad.  	negative
	We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	positive
	But I don't like it.	negative
	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	positive
	It was horrible!.	negative
	New Battery works great in phone.	positive
	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	negative
	We definately enjoyed ourselves.	positive
	Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  	negative
	It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  	positive
	What a mistake.	negative
	This is a GREAT place to eat!	positive
	There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	negative
	It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.  	positive
	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).	negative
	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	positive
	) Don't waste your time.  	negative
	Best tacos in town by far!!	positive
	If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	negative
	Everything was fresh and delicious!	positive
	The script is horrendously stupid.  	negative
	All the bread is made in-house!	positive
	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	negative
	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	positive
	The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	negative
	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	positive
	When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	negative
	There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	positive
	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	negative
	Very good, though!	positive
	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	negative
	is pretty funny.  	positive
	The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	negative
	It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	positive
	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	negative
	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.	positive
	I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.	negative
	My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	positive
	Internet is excrutiatingly slow.	negative
	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	positive
	I was so insulted.	negative
	The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	positive
	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	negative
	)Setup couldn't have been simpler.	positive
	It was not good.	negative
	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	positive
	Terrible service!	negative
	The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	positive
	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	negative
	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	positive
	The battery is completely useless to me.	negative
	The food was very good.	positive
	poor voice clarity.	negative
	Overall, a great experience.	positive
	Soggy and not good.	negative
	It was delicious!!!	positive
	I'm not eating here!	negative
	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	positive
	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	negative
	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	positive
	Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	negative
	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	positive
	Very disappointing.	negative
	The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	positive
	The battery runs down quickly.	negative
	Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	positive
	I was not impressed by this product.	negative
	Food was delicious!	positive
	i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	negative
	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	positive
	It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	negative
	I gave it a 10  	positive
	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	negative
	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	positive
	In short, don't bother with this movie.  	negative
	The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	positive
	How awful she is!  	negative
	Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	positive
	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  	negative
	Better Than New.	positive
	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  	negative
	See it.  	positive
	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	negative
	I am glad I purchased it.	positive
	The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	negative
	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	positive
	We'll never go again.	negative
	I would recommend saving room for this!	positive
	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	negative
	Price is good too.	positive
	Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	negative
	In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	positive
	The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	negative
	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	positive
	Piece of Junk.	negative
	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	positive
	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	negative
	Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	positive
	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	negative
	If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	positive
	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	negative
	The camera really likes her in this movie.  	positive
	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	negative
	Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!	positive
	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	negative
	The design is very good.4.	positive
	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	negative
	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	positive
	Tasted like dirt.	negative
	This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.	positive
	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	negative
	Bacon is hella salty.	positive
	The result is a film that just don't look right.  	negative
	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	positive
	I'll even say it again Â this is torture.  	negative
	The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.	positive
	I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  	negative
	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	positive
	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	negative
	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	positive
	It's just painful!  	negative
	After charging overnight, these batteries work great.	positive
	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	negative
	All things considered, a job very well done.  	positive
	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	negative
	They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	positive
	Lasted one day and then blew up.	negative
	The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	positive
	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	negative
	The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	positive
	But now I was completely grossed out.	negative
	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	positive
	The manager was the worst.	negative
	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	positive
	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	negative
	- Really, really good rice, all the time.	positive
	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	negative
	I would highly recommend this product.	positive
	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	negative
	The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	positive
	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	negative
	If you want a real scare rent this one!  	positive
	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.	negative
	It Was So Cool.  	positive
	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	negative
	This place has it!	positive
	If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	negative
	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa AurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	positive
	The service here is fair at best.	negative
	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	positive
	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	negative
	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	positive
	This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	negative
	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	positive
	At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	negative
	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	positive
	i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	negative
	Excellent bluetooth headset.	positive
	If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	negative
	This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	positive
	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	negative
	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	positive
	I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	negative
	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	positive

	awesome device.	positive
	The acting was bad.  	negative
	Now I know that I made a wise decision.	positive
	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	negative

	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.	negative

	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	negative
	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	positive
	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	negative

	It's AGGRAVATING!	negative
	I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	positive
	Very disappointing.  	negative
	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	positive
	But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.	negative
	Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	positive

	I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.	negative
	The cast is good.  	positive
	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	negative
	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	positive
	Truly awful.	negative
	I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	positive
	Don't buy it.	negative
	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	positive
	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	negative
	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	positive

	This movie is BAD.  	negative

	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.	positive
	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	negative

	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	positive
	Boy was that sucker dry!!.	negative

	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	positive
	Could not get strong enough signal.	negative
	All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	positive
	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	negative
	It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.	positive

	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	positive
	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	negative
	But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  	positive
	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	negative
	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	positive
	We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	negative
	Service is also cute.	positive
	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	negative
	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	positive

	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	negative
	For the price this was a great deal.	positive
	The visual effects were AWFUL.  	negative
	He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  	positive
	Horrible!  	negative
	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	positive
	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	negative
	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.	positive
	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	negative

	I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.	positive
	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	negative
	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	positive
	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	negative
	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	positive
	Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.	negative
	I highly recommend this case.	positive
	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	negative
	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	positive
	Buttons are too small.	negative
	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	positive
	I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	negative
	5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	positive
	Used and dirty.	negative
	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	positive

	Disappointed with battery.	negative
	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	positive
	The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	negative
	I would highly recommend this.	positive
	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	negative
	I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	positive
	Disappointed!.	negative
	It's practically perfect in all of them Â a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  	positive
	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	negative
	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	positive
	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	negative
	I liked it.  	positive
	It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	negative
	Highly recommended.	positive
	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	negative

	Pretty piece of junk.	negative
	And the sound quality is great.	positive
	Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	negative
	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	positive
	AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.	negative

	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	positive
	So just beware.	negative
	Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	positive
	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	negative
	I rate this movie 9/10.  	positive
	They dropped more than the ball.	negative
	He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	positive

	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	positive
	It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	negative
	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	positive
	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	negative
	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	positive
	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	negative
	The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	positive
	I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	negative
	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	positive

	I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	negative
	In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	positive
	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	negative

	The concert sequences just sucked.  	negative
	Does everything it should and more.	positive
	As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	negative

	(It works!)	positive
	I will not return.	negative
	So Far So Good!.	positive
	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	negative

	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	positive
	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	negative

	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	negative
	the cast was great.  	positive
	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	negative
	Great food and awesome service!	positive
	I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  	negative
	The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	positive
	Lots of holes in the script.  	negative
	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	positive
	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	negative
	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	positive
	It's just lame.  	negative
	Overall, a delight!  	positive
	What happened next was pretty....off putting.	negative
	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	positive
	Buy a different phone - but not this.	negative
	Her role was played well.  	positive
	A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.	negative
	It even has its sweet moments.  	positive
	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	negative
	Good product, good seller.	positive
	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	negative
	Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	positive
	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.	negative
	Iam very pleased with my purchase.	positive
	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	negative
	Ambience is perfect.	positive
	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	negative
	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	positive
	Everything about this product is wrong.First	negative
	Hitchcock is a great director.  	positive
	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.	negative
	I great reception all the time.	positive
	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	negative
	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	positive
	However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	negative
	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	positive
	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	negative
	What I really like there is the crepe station.	positive
	Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	negative
	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	positive
	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	negative
	Excellent product.	positive
	Dont waste your money...	negative
	I really enjoyed eating here.	positive
	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	negative
	These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	positive
	Service sucks.	negative
	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	positive
	Thank you for wasting my money.	negative
	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	positive
	Very, very sad.	negative
	You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	positive
	Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	negative
	Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	positive
	Just does not work.	negative
	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	positive
	Worst martini ever!	negative
	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	positive

	Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	positive
	Plug was the wrong size.	negative
	I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	positive
	Not impressed.	negative
	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	positive
	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	negative
	After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  	positive
	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!	negative
	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	positive

	This is high adventure at its best.  	positive
	If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	negative
	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	positive
	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.	negative
	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	positive
	The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	negative
	Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	positive
	I've never been treated so bad.	negative
	I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	positive
	God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	negative
	There still are good actors around!  	positive
	there is no real plot.  	negative
	I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	positive
	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	negative
	Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	positive
	Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	negative
	The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	positive
	The desserts were a bit strange.	negative
	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	positive
	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	negative
	Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	positive
	A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  	negative
	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	positive
	For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	negative
	This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	positive
	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	negative
	This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	positive
	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	negative
	My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	positive
	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	negative
	Very prompt service.	positive
	disappointed.	negative
	Love the margaritas, too!	positive
	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	negative
	The reception is excellent!	positive
	If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	negative
	I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	positive

	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	negative
	The phone loads super!	positive
	Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  	negative
	What a great double cheeseburger!	positive
	All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.	negative
	Best breakfast buffet!!!	positive
	Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  	negative
	I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	positive

	The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	positive
	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	negative
	Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  	positive
	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	negative

	Cumbersome design.	negative
	The aerial scenes were well-done.  	positive
	The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	negative
	The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	positive
	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	negative
	This is a great deal.	positive
	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	negative
	Beautiful styling though.	positive

	Would not reccommend.	negative

	It was equally awful.	negative
	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	positive
	He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  	negative
	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	positive
	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	negative
	Nice solid keyboard.	positive
	I was mortified.	negative
	I rather enjoyed it.  	positive
	Poor quality.	negative
	This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  	positive
	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	negative
	The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	positive
	Reception is terrible and full of static.	negative
	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	positive
	About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	negative
	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	positive
	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	negative
	Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.	positive
	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	negative
	Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	positive
	I am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	negative
	You can't beat that.	positive
	It is not good.  	negative
	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	positive
	We will not be coming back.	negative
	I keep watching it over and over.  	positive
	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	negative
	I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	positive
	for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	negative
	I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.	positive
	Design Flaw?.	negative
	It looked like a wonderful story.  	positive
	Needless to say, I wasted my money.	negative
	Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	positive
	Avoid at all cost!	negative
	Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	positive
	I came out of it feeling angry.  	negative
	I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.	positive
	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	negative
	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	positive
	What a waste.	negative
	Sooooo good!!	positive
	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.	negative
	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	positive
	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  	negative
	I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	positive
	The script is a big flawed mess.  	negative
	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	positive
	So bad.  	negative
	If you're not familiar, check it out.	positive
	Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	negative
	Worked great!.	positive
	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	negative
	Great charger.	positive
	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	negative
	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	positive
	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	negative
	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	positive
	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	negative
	This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	positive
	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	negative
	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	positive
	I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	negative
	I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  	positive
	All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  	negative
	Easy to use.	positive
	Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	negative
	I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.	positive
	Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	negative
	Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	positive
	It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.	negative
	Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	positive
	The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  	negative
	This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	positive
	I thought it was bad.  	negative
	It worked very well.	positive
	Service was slow and not attentive.	negative
	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	positive
	Terrible management.	negative
	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	positive
	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	negative
	Check it out.	positive
	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	negative
	All in all I think it was a good investment.	positive
	The commercials are the most misleading.	negative
	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	positive
	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	negative
	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	positive
	The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	negative
	Best headset ever!!!.	positive
	Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!	negative
	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	positive
	Then the film just dropped the ball.  	negative
	How awesome is that.	positive
	That company is a joke.	negative
	This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	positive
	Again, no plot at all.  	negative
	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	positive
	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	negative
	When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	positive
	I give it 2 thumbs down	negative
	Blue Ant is easy to use.	positive
	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	negative
	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	positive
	Will never, ever go back.	negative
	Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	positive
	Sending it back.	negative
	The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	positive
	The pleather case doesn't fit.	negative
	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.	positive
	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	negative
	Also makes it easier to hold on to.	positive
	Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	negative
	Great product and price.	positive
	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	negative
	I'm so happy to be here!!!"	positive
	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	negative
	Good Service-check!	positive
	Even worse than Ticker!  	negative
	John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	positive
	But the service was beyond bad.	negative
	He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	positive
	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	negative
	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	positive
	The management is rude.	negative
	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	positive
	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.	negative
	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	positive
	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	negative
	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	positive
	Very Displeased.	negative
	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	positive
	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	negative
	The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	positive
	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	negative
	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	positive
	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	negative
	The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	positive
	Not easy to watch.  	negative
	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	positive
	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	negative
	The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	positive
	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	negative
	It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	positive
	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	negative
	Great Earpiece.	positive
	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	negative
	It is an insane game.  	positive
	In a word, it is embarrassing.  	negative
	Food was so gooodd.	positive
	What a waste of money and time!.	negative
	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	positive
	Terrible product, and waste of money!	negative
	He deserves 5 stars.	positive
	A truly, truly bad film.  	negative
	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	positive
	The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.	negative
	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	positive
	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	negative
	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	positive
	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	negative
	Great price also!	positive
	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	negative
	This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	positive
	Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.	negative
	Ample portions and good prices.	positive
	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	negative
	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	positive
	Very bad Experience!	negative
	We were promptly greeted and seated.	positive
	It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	negative
	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	positive
	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	negative
	Five star Plus, plus.	positive
	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	negative
	W810i is just SUPERB.	positive
	The soundtrack sucked.  	negative
	Will order from them again!	positive
	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	negative
	Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  	positive
	Poor sound quality.	negative
	That was funny.  	positive
	I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of QuÃ©bec.  	negative
	Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.	positive
	About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  	negative
	Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	positive
	The film looks cheap and bland.  	negative
	Superb Phone on a Great Network.	positive
	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.	negative
	Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	positive
	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.	negative
	His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	positive
	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	negative
	We'd definitely go back here again.	positive
	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	negative
	Comfortable in my hand.	positive
	Don't bother - go to the store.	negative
	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	positive
	Does Not Work.	negative
	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	positive
	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	negative
	Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	positive
	poor quality and service.	negative
	I love this phone!.	positive
	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	negative
	I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	positive
	This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  	negative
	I love this device.	positive
	It was so BORING!  	negative
	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	positive
	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	negative
	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	positive
	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.	negative
	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.	positive
	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	negative
	very good product, well made.	positive
	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	negative
	The fries were great too.	positive
	So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.	negative
	Great Hands Free Device.	positive
	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	negative
	I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	positive
	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	negative
	Made very sturdy.	positive
	Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	negative
	The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	positive
	All three broke within two months of use.	negative
	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	positive
	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	negative
	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.	positive
	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	negative
	Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	positive
	This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	negative
	Also great directing and photography.  	positive
	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	negative
	This place is two thumbs up....way up.	positive
	But I definitely would not eat here again.	negative
	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	positive
	Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.	negative
	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	positive
	Don't do it!!!!	negative
	Damn good steak.	positive
	Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	negative
	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	positive
	Don't make the same mistake I did.	negative
	Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	positive
	No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	negative
	That was nice.  	positive
	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	negative
	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	positive
	Rip off---- Over charge shipping.	negative
	Great pork sandwich.	positive
	I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.	negative
	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	positive
	The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  	negative
	Battery is holding up well.	positive
	Avoid this one if you can.	negative
	Good Quality.	positive
	The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  	negative
	Great phone.	positive
	Wasted two hours.  	negative
	" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	positive
	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	negative
	Great product.	positive
	I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  	negative
	For that, it's worth checking out.  	positive
	Never got it!!!!!	negative
	After one bite, I was hooked.	positive
	I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	negative
	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	positive
	I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	negative
	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	positive
	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	negative
	We would recommend these to others.	positive
	Won't go back.	negative
	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	positive
	Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	negative
	The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	positive
	The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  	negative
	Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	positive
	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.	negative
	Service was fantastic.	positive
	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	negative
	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	positive
	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	negative
	This is a good joint.	positive
	This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	negative
	lightweight and works well.	positive
	Freezes frequently4.	negative
	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	positive
	Do not waste your money here!	negative
	VERY comfortable.	positive
	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	negative
	you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.	positive
	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	negative
	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	positive
	I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	negative
	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	positive
	putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  	negative
	Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	positive
	I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.	negative
	Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	positive
	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	negative
	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	positive
	There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  	negative
	It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	positive
	Unreliable - I'm giving up.	negative
	Good case, Excellent value.	positive
	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	negative
	The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	positive
	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	negative
	All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	positive
	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	negative
	The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	positive
	I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	negative
	Nice headset priced right.	positive
	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	negative
	And I really did find them funny.  	positive
	Would not go back.	negative
	I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	positive
	On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	negative
	It is a joy to use.	positive
	Really awful.  	negative
	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	positive
	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	negative
	The reception through this headset is excellent.	positive
	Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	negative
	Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	positive
	Excellent starter wireless headset.	negative
	The case is great and works fine with the 680.	positive
	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	negative
	Simple, lightweight and great fit.	positive
	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	negative
	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	positive
	I could not recommend these more.	negative
	I'm pleased.	positive
	That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  	negative
	The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	positive
	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	negative
	Waitress was good though!	positive
	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	negative
	Great audio!.	positive
	Mic Doesn't work.	negative
	Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	positive
	You get what you pay for I guess.	negative
	Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	positive
	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	negative
	Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	positive
	The story is beyond stupid.  	negative
	Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	positive
	Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	negative
	It's a great item.	positive
	Bad Quality.	negative
	Love this headset!	positive
	Customer service was terrible.	negative
	Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.	positive
	Do not make the same mistake as me.	negative
