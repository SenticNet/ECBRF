	Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.	0 star
	Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n\n1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n\n2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n\nAside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service.	1 star
	Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \"kind of like Coors Light\".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though.	1 star
	This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here.	3 star
	Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.	3 star
	Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time.	2 star
	This place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off. \n\nThe food was pretty good, but because of the service I won't be returning.	2 star
	This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. I got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). The food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an Applebee's knockoff (and Applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway). \n\n3 stars	2 star
	I think the location in homestead has ruined this place. Dirty dirty dirty.\n\nBathrooms unkept, entry door handle and windows filthy\n\nPizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched. Server was coarse, not refined\n\nServing items were old and rusty. Temperature of food was not hot\n\nLow quality, but probably ok with pittsburgher s	2 star
	I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service.	0 star
	This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.	4 star
	Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.	3 star
	Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees	3 star
	This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!	4 star
	This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh.	4 star
	Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there.	1 star
	Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.	1 star
	The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive.	3 star
	The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \"krab\", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.	1 star
	So I went back to Casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch! But it's not worth the money for dinner. Mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food...	2 star
	This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.	3 star
	To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.	2 star
	Stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. In hindsight, we wish we had stayed here. :-)\n\nWe had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. I hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. I like this funkier part of town.	2 star
	Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room.	0 star
	right by my house, spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing.	3 star
	Love this place! The decor inside is really cool.\n\nI'm not from the area but I try to stop in every time I'm traveling through. So many great veg options and great drinks.	3 star
	It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from.	0 star
	Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!	4 star
	Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here.	0 star
	The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!\n\nI am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!	2 star
	Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..	0 star
	For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym.	3 star
	Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.	1 star
	The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and car museum is cool; and it's neat to walk through the greenhouse.  Those are free.  However, nothing really separates the $12 house tour from other house tours.  Like the other ones, the docents don't focus on anything interesting, like history or the architecture or the building itself.  They focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich.  Kind of like hearing about Paris Hilton or the Kardashians.  B-o-r-i-n-g. And what kind of tourist attraction doesn't allow pictures?	1 star
	Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back.	1 star
	I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's.	4 star
	OK so another winner in this neighborhood besides Nicky's.  The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.  Katie our server was professional AND personable and only added to our outstanding meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with.   WOW what a place.  The only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  Well worth the trip!	4 star
	Those who know, know this is the place to buy your cases of beer. The prices are low and the tax is included in the price tag, but the best reason to shop here is Sam. He is a character, knows a lot about beer and is a really nice guy.  First time we stopped by, he invited us into his shop and stock area and we talked for quite a while before departing with some real good beer.  Sam Caruso has a story for almost every occasion and  the beer to match each occasion. A real Pittsburgh place.	4 star
	This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \"made in the 70s\" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.	0 star

	This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city.	0 star
	I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!	4 star

	you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \"soul-food\" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ...	1 star
	Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!	1 star

	This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.	0 star
	Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!	0 star
	Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales.	0 star
	The pizza is great. Other food items might disappoint. They do deliver! Service is hit and miss. There is one rude,  smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service.	2 star
	Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine.	4 star
	What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.	4 star
	The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location.	1 star
	MUCH nicer since the renovation! The only thing I don't love is that there are rarely baskets near the entrance, and it's weird how you have to go through the whole produce area to get to the rest of the store!\n\nCheckers are usually friendly here, and good selection and variety.	3 star
	Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area.	1 star
	Spent the weekend and Pittsburgh and started out Friday night at Mad Mex for Happy Hour and some dinner. Happy Hour was a pretty good deal with half price wings and cheap drafts. The wings were good and the beer selection is above average.\n\nFor dinner I had the carnitas enchiladas (i think). It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.	2 star
	Stopped by with my laptop late last Friday afternoon to enjoy some craft brews and prep for a class I'm teaching Saturday morning.  Normally I have nothing but great things to say about Mad Mex in Scott Town Center, but I was mildly annoyed by a new server who seemed to abandon me after finding out I wished to stay and work after purchasing my meal and buying several craft brews.  This is not the normal treatment at this establishment for the guy at table #28 with the laptop.  In any case, great food & great selection of microbrews!	4 star
	This location has such a different feel than the others around Pittsburgh. Perhaps it's the well-lit bar, or maybe it's that there's a new bartender every time I make it over here. In any case, it doesn't quite have the \"feel\" that North Hills and Robinson have.	2 star
	Parking = terrible\nService = just ok\nFood = decent\nAtmosphere = really nice but loud\nDrinks = margaritas are ok\n\nComing here I wouldn't get anything else other than the burritos it fajitas. Really disappointed in the quesadilla I had here. Guacamole is pretty bland but the salsa has a nice spicy kick. Neat place to hang out if in the mood for Mexican like food and atmosphere.	2 star
	I do like my Mad Mex, however predictable and non-authentic it may be.  The portion sizes are mammoth and I come away with a satisfied sense of regret.  Their beer menu is happily extensive.  Charging me $9 for chips and salsa is a bit of crime, wouldn't ya say though!?!  I mean, c'mon!  Our service has most times been lacking--a bit rushed and on the inattentive side.  Also, why do you require your wait staff to not servestraws/ lemons/etc unless asked by cusotmers---weirdness-cut out these odd cost-cutting, anti-service friendly measures please.	2 star
	Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.	2 star
	The close-to-my-childhood-home Starbucks: it's A. Not Peet's, and B. An accidental high school reunion when I dare to venture in. On the other hand, there are usually couches--or chairs and tables--available, inside or outside, depending on the season.\n\nThis is the option when I don't want to try to park on Beverly for a caffeine fix at the Coffee Tree.	2 star
	This is exactly what I was looking for in a hotel during my one night stay in Pittsburgh. Close to the city, but far enough out to get free parking and a reasonable rate (under $100).\n\nThe room was fairly small, but I was only planning on sleeping in it. It was clean so I couldn't ask for much more. The people at the front desk were very friendly too.\n\nIf I go back to Pittsburgh, I will absolutely stay here again.	2 star
	We are new to the area. We bought a 100 year old home in the Dormont suburb of Pittsburgh and set about to do a serious renovation. The moment we walked into Ceramiche we knew we were in good hands. Tina, Bob, Melissa, Suzy and Nicky all know their stuff and treat us like long lost friends. The selection of tile is the best we have found in this area and the prices are very good. The service is what really makes this place special.	4 star
	Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm.	4 star
	A good Starbucks.  There is always a line at this one due to it's location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly.  Today I had a salted camel mocha.  It was pretty amazing.\n\nThis location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days.	3 star
	You've got to book with Liz!\n\nIf you have curly hair (or even not) she is the best in the burgh.  Nails it every time.  Love her personality and attention to detail.  I really feel like she listens to what I want but will tell me what she thinks, in a kind way. She's energetic, attentive, and just really knows hair.  \n\nHave been back multiple times and each time I leave happy: cut, color, and all.  Probably the first time i've actually stuck with a stylist.  Thanks Liz!	4 star
	Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color..	0 star
	I always had a good experience eating here for lunch.  Yea it is a bit run down, but name some in the strip that aren't?  They have $5.00 lunch specials and Jimmy was always very nice and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me back.  Funny.. Highly recommend.	4 star
	If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus.	1 star
	Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.	0 star
	How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!	0 star
	Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big, over-the-top, tasteless, and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately, this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.\n\nIt seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place, which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However, if you're not from Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.\n\nBy the way, do not pronounce the \"t\" in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced \"Primanny.\"  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way.	1 star
	Tiny little place and very popular...highly suggest going early if you're a newbie in town and never had their sammiches before. They get pretty busy after 12.\n\nI couldn't decide what to get, and was told their number 2 popular choice is  not that great and I should try salami or black angus. Tough! So, I ended going with roast beef. I really enjoyed it, not greasy at all, and I actually ate the whole thing. Ha unbelievable, it was that good! \n\nOverall service was great.	3 star
	This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me.	1 star
	There was basically no cheese on my \"cheese combo sandwich\", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us.	0 star
	I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!	2 star
	Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future.	3 star

	This spot was the light of my life for about 3 solid weeks. From the first bite I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out of pittsburgh and paying my friend for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss xou and cant wait to hold xou again.	4 star
	I would give it 3.5 stars. It was a solid sandwich for sure. I got the corned beef which was tasty the only thing I wish they added was some kind of sauce. I'm not sure if that comes on other sandwiches but it could have used some kind of mustard. The price is great too, four sandwiches , two orders of pickles, coleslaw, fries and beer for about 40 bucks. Can't complain about that! \n\nI would definitely	2 star
	This is a solid downtown lunch break spot. They run a special between like 11-2 where you can get 3 cuts buffet style (with lots of different types) with a pop for 6 or 7 bucks. Perfect for those days when you oversleep and don't get a chance to pack a lunch. The pizza is nothing that you'd fall asleep dreaming of, but definitely hits the spot at 1PM on a workin' day.	2 star
	I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary.	1 star
	WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better .	0 star
	So Many coffees to choose from, so little time. Really awesome coffee shoppe, which happens to be the oldest in the city and the most delicious smelling!

Definitely a good place to stop if your around market square	4 star
	I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!	4 star
	Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back.	2 star
	I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti.	0 star
	No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate.	0 star
	Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.	0 star
	Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \"daily special\" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \"two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh...	1 star
	Wonderful experience!	4 star
	average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. \n\nThe beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside. \n\nChicken quesidilla, same thing. Average. \n\nI've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping.	1 star
	They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.	1 star
	It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.	0 star
	i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!	4 star
	The selection is pretty vast -- European, upscale specialty brands (up to $24 for a 3 oz bar!), bulk malt balls in 3 flavors that are wonderful, house-brand hot chocolate mix, and lots more. It's fun just to browse around and know all these choices exist.	3 star
	I have seen a lot of shows here.  It's really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city.  \n\n(and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!)	3 star
	This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business.	0 star
	Good Coffee and Travel Advice!  What more can you ask?\n\nA buddy and I decided to explore the strip district one Saturday and found this gem of a coffee shop.    We ordered a couple a Cappuccino's.    The employees were very nice and provided some good insight on what to see and visit.\n\nThe Caps were good, the vibe was great and it is in the heart of the Strip District.   A strong recommend.	3 star
	this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. \n\nThis gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)	3 star
	Not four-star cuisine, but good Take Out.   As you can tell I am a regular lunch goer on Penn Avenue. The take out food at Fu Lai is always dependable and the price is reasonable.  Because I prefer my food to be a little on the plain side, I always get the chicken with pea pods or the chicken with vegetables.  Very satisfying!	2 star
	This place is great. We purchased the smoked prosciutto, hard salami, and peperoni when we stopped in. The counter staff was very friendly, despite being VERY busy, and made some excellent recommendations. \n\nNext time I'm going to add a selection of cheeses to my purchase of cured meat.	3 star
	No fax machine. No electronic records. No emails or computers.  I have to keep track of my pet's vaccination records?  What's up with that? The doctors are very nice and seem competent.  Front desk support is generally ok, but had a phone conversation with someone who must have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed...  Options are limited for those of us who live downtown.	2 star
	What a great dinner!  I had the pasta trio special.  They walk around with three pastas and just re-fill your plate.  I even wanted one of them without an ingredient,and they didn't bat an eye.  They even had the pasta prepared the same way to refill me!  I haven't been back, and I kick myself for it on my way out of town every time I visit there!	4 star
	For those stuck in the convention center area, this is a ok place for a beer and pub food.\n\nAs a graduate student in the area only to attend a conference, I have been to this bar twice.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers and onion rings are a favorite. The buffalo wings are ok...nothing special.\n\nGets very crowded during games, but makes the place fun.\n\nSo, if you are trapped around the area with no car and crave a beer and munchies, this place is A-Ok.	2 star
	Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap.	1 star
	Awesome chowder but that's it...	1 star
	Not what I expected!  This place is a Pittsburgh institution.  I expected mahogany and brass, but walked into a tiny diner.\n\nVery friendly.  The fish is awesome.  The huge Calimari rings are absurdly tender.  No gumminess at all.  \n\nThe place is crazy at lunch time, so I never even attempted it until now.  Worked late and still a decent crowd.	2 star
	This restaurant is great for anyone in the mood for seafood. The clam chowder is as creamy and flavorful as everyone says it is. The fish and shrimp are very fresh, though the crab cake was nothing special. The place is a historic landmark, and the decor suits the laid-back atmosphere. The service is pretty friendly, too. Overall, I didn't find the experience as bad as others have in the past, and the restaurant is worth checking out.	3 star
	This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid.	0 star
	Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.	0 star
	Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL.	1 star
	I would say that Lemongrass is ok, not great.\n\nI've had the Panang curry a few times and really enjoyed it. The Green curry is also decent.\n\nWhat brings Lemongrass down is incredibly slow service. Whether it's during a busy time or a slow time, it's slow slow slow. One waiter for the entire restaurant and that's it.\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant are nice. And given the price, it's not a bad lunch spot.	2 star
	Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast. I trusted Yelp! reviews but they let me down. I may try one of the other barbers with real shears once more but I am hesitant to recommend or go back here with  confidence.	1 star
	You won't find a better haircut for the price in all of Pittsburgh. \n\nI spent my first year in Pittsburgh not knowing where to get a good haircut. I tried a bunch of different places, and often settled for an overpriced buzz at Supercuts. The day I found Dan Cercone was a life changer for me.\n\nIf you go on a Saturday, one of their moms bakes cookies and has other random complimentary snacks. Following my last visit, I walked out of there looking sharp, munching on a vanilla Powerbar. (Only a couple munches, that thing was gross)	4 star
	I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.	4 star
	5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.	0 star
	This place is awesome.  He was closed but was still there cleaning and took me in for a great old school cut.  I'd tried some salons and was relying on Sueprcuts a lot and hadn't been to a barber in quite some time.  Sure, I haven't had this kind of haircut since gradeschool, but he did clean it up quite nicely and even gave my beard a clean trim.  Definitely recommended if this is what you're looking for.  Also, some great conversation	3 star
	Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly	2 star
	I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this.	3 star
	The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment.	1 star
	Ritters is a Pittsburgh treasure. Old school diner, complete with at-table mini jukeboxes that sometimes work. Great people watching here.  This is the place you come for late night munchies or possibly morning after recovery.  Breakfast food is on point, as is the Greek fare. Cash only like most of the coolest spots in The Burgh!	2 star
	I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had, but still very good.  I had a cheeseburger with mushrooms and bacon.  The bun was unfortunately too small for the patty and the top portion of the bun was rock hard.  The burger was extremely large and cooked very well.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food was out immediately.	2 star
	All the locals recommended this place to me for burgers and I've tried them twice to just make sure the first time wasn't a goof. But both times, the food was so blah. It should take more then just a massive piece of meat to get good ratings. I've tried both a burger and a steak, and they were both so bland. There's no flavor what's so ever. I was highly disappointed.	2 star
	Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.	0 star
	Flies in this place.	0 star
	i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls, through the rice wrapper i could see that the lettuce was browning, a sure sign that the rolls were not made to order.  the pad thai was dry and tasteless.  my friends curry and potatoes tasted like water with a touch of curry powder.  i hate giving poor reviews but nothing that i ate at thai cuisine was yummy.	0 star
	Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! \n\nIf you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!	4 star
	I only come to Pittsburgh twice a year, but I get so excited to eat the best pizza. Sacramento pizzarias have nothing on Pittsburgh's. Fiori's is the best pizza I've ever eaten. It's local so my dad grew up eating the stuff & so did I until I moved to California. Sweet sauce and thin crust baked to perfection. If you're in Pittsburgh, you must try it. If you live in Pittsburgh, then you already know what I'm talking about.	4 star
	Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon	2 star
	Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.	4 star
	Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \nIt wasn't horrible.	2 star
	My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach.	4 star
	The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!	4 star
	First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one.	1 star
	New pita caf\u00e9 is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming	4 star
	yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.\n\ni always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday.	3 star
	NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also, service was unfriendly.	0 star
	This place has been on my list since I became a \"foodie\" (quotes intended) ... and finally I was in town with the flexibility to go.\n\nIt's worth it ... I think it's on par with Pizzeria Bianco and Pupatellas as \"as good as it gets\" for me ... and the great pastas and apps solidified the five star rating.\n\nVERY great.	4 star
	Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style.	2 star
	Convenient and easier to find items then big box stores, although you do pay for that convenience. Most staff are extremely knowledgeable and helpful, others in dire need of customer service training (mocking and eye rolling at customers is not cool).  Returns can be a hassle including items sold that are defective or missing parts.	2 star
	This is a great local place for the neighborhood. There aren't many general shops or convenience stores within walking distance, so Rolliers is my go-to store. Their employees (beyond the local teens at the registers) are very friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems finding plumbing, storage, or cleaning supplies.	3 star
	Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers.	1 star
	This is a fantastic small hair salon. I have been going here for years and they are experts. You always feel valued and always have great service (and a GREAT cut too!).\nThe ambiance is superb- small, quaint, and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this caliber.\n\nI highly recommend!!!	4 star
	Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else.	1 star
	Cute place with a delicious cap! Perfectly proportionate.	3 star
	Wash-dry-fold. Pick-up and delivery. Dress shirts. Dry cleaning. These people do so much, and charge such a reasonable amount. \n\nThey take credit cards, too, and they are easy to communicate with, if you have a change of plans or whatever.\n\nCan't say enough good things. I've been in the laundromat, too, though I haven't used it. It's nice and clean and pleasant, in that Pittsburgh's-take-on-hip kind of way.	4 star
	I was here this past week while visiting. The food was superb. The seared tuna was amazing-the best I've had anywhere. The scallops were also excellent. Appetizers were delicious. The restaurant is beautiful, dimly lit, and very relaxed. Our server, Amanda, was great-really knowledgeable and helpful. Lookinf forward to my next trip to Pitt. to come back here.	4 star
	Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!	4 star
	Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35. \n\nI do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour.	2 star
	Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks.	4 star
	Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well.	4 star
	Two Words: Frozen Cosmos\n\nYou need no other motivation to go to Harris' (although, the food and service is good too)	3 star
	harris grill, i think  your menu is trying too hard.\n\nfirst place i went on my visit to pittsburgh.  menu was a little overly silly, waitress was a little underly friendly/helpful/timely, and food, while decent, was overpriced for the quality.\n\ni may be back to pittsburgh, but won't be back to harris grill	1 star
	Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.	3 star
	Sunday night, one week after the Steelers were officially \"out\".  The restaurant was not crowded.  There were (2) 20-somethings and (2) 50-somethings which turned into (2) Burgers (1) Pulled Pork and (1) Angus Salad.  \n\nEverything was done perfectly.  Calamari was spicy, tender and fantastic.\n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  Almost too dark to enjoy the meal, but ok.  We all agreed that we'd like to go back and try out a few other menu items.  Especially in the summer, to try out the patio!	3 star
	This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area.	1 star
	I just got my hair done at Dean of Shadyside Salon with Valerie. My cut was amazing. She listened to what I wanted out of my hair cut and gave me advice on what I should do to achieve the look I wanted as well. \nI was so excited about my cut, I re-booked for cut and color.	4 star
	Typical sports bar with great wings! Kitchen Sink Wings were $.50 each the night we went. The fried zucchini was great as well (more breading then zucchini, but it doesn't matter after a few beers). We also tried the nachos and tater tots, which were fine. Service was great! They also have daily beer specials.	2 star
	I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.	0 star
	They have the best Burnt Almond Torte, so Good!   And if you like lady locks their the best I've had also.  Another of my favorites are the little cake cups they make .  There are a variety, like Burnt Almond Torte, Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry, German Chocolate, and so on.  Its the perfect miniature dessert!\n\nFor my daughters wedding I ordered five dozen of these for the cookie table. They were a nice addition to the cookies and display beautifully.  They were a Big Hit!	4 star
	Almond torte cake is way too overhyped.  I ordered one after seeing an article on Huffington Post so with a description like that who wouldn't want to try it!?  It's a diabetics worst nightmare, sugar overload. The filling in the middle had a bland taste, nothing special about it. Maybe it's because I ordered the cake and had it shipped to MD that it tasted bad.  People raving about this cake should try middle eastern or Greek bakeries! I gave a two because they have great customer service when emailing back.	1 star
	Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth.	1 star
	This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well.	3 star
	Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you.	4 star
	I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot.	3 star
	Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead.	4 star
	I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there.	0 star
	If you are drunk.... as in silly drunk, loud drunk, agitated drunk, confused drunk, mellow drunk, giggly drunk, lost drunk, or still-have-$5-in-your-pocket drunk... this is where you want to eat. \n\nYou're likely to have amusing memories here as you sort of sober up with other hungry drunk people who are all lured in by the aroma of pizza. Note: the pizza tastes like a slice-of-heart-attack during the daytime, however there is something oh so good about it when eaten at 1:45 am.	2 star
	One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.	0 star
	Definitely a great place to go if you've had a long night of drinking. They even have a special called the \"Morning After Breakfast\". I found the food greasy, and the pancakes, I wish they had a more regular style. But it's a great place to meet up and catch up with friends! It is cash-only, btw.	2 star
	I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you.	2 star
	Iv'e been to better places. I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there. I usually order their omelets. The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere, nice service, but the food is blah	2 star
	Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer.	2 star
	The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again.	0 star
	Good food, cooked well, came out hot. Service was also very good. Waitress came back to top off coffees more than once. Prices also good, but cash only. Wouldn't wait if a really long line, but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out.	3 star
	Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.	3 star
	Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \"help wanted\" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.	0 star
	Cash only. We love their Crepes. I don't like latta that much. It is good experience.	3 star
	Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee.	3 star
	Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!\n\nIts also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. \n\nAll that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out.	2 star
	Moving from the Midwest, I was pumped when I found this place at their former location in Squirrel Hill and discovered their vast vegetarian menu. General Tso's soy protein is a winner, although a bit sweet. They retained their veg menu at their Shadyside site and it's the same. Lunch is the way to go here--very expensive otherwise. Beware of soup--kind of got congealed in transit. \n\nOverall, this place holds a special place in my heart as it's very veg-friendly. However there are better Chinese places in PGH.	2 star
	I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \n\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.	4 star
	The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.	0 star
	Good food.  Quick delivery.  *CAUTION*  The $2.00 delivery charge is not listed on the menu.  SURPRISE...It's listed on your bill.  *CAUTION*   A tad pricey.  Oh yeah..I live in Pittsburgh now...	2 star
	Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business.	1 star
	This is a very family-friendly, casual seafood restaurant with nice portions and great prices.  They serve both fried and broiled seafood, as well as steak and chicken. I had the broiled salmon with the baked sweet potato and salad bar.  I also tried a vinegar-based cole slaw (think similar to cold sauerkraut) from the salad bar and it was great. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient.	3 star
	Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!	3 star
	My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. \n\nLong, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS.	0 star
	I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!	4 star
	These guys definitely know how to make a good pizza. The crust is the perfect blend of chewy with a hint of crunch, totally foldable and delicious! Not only do the make a good pie, they do it quickly, even when it's busy, and get it to your door still hot and tasty. They've officially made it into my phone contact list!	3 star
	They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again.	3 star
	Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place.	3 star
	Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!\n\nThis is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.\n\nFrom a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling.	1 star
	I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.	3 star
	We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share.	3 star
	Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.	1 star
	Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.\n\nJared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!	4 star
	I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe.	0 star
	We stayed at a hampton inn in concord one night, then this hampton the next night. This one was so much better, except for the room we were in. 602 made us both sick, it had a mold or something. The front desk was very courteous in moving us when this was mentioned and the 2nd room was very nice. Breakfast was delish. And the hotel is located in a very nice area, right next to southpark mall and right down the road from carowinds :)	3 star
	I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!	4 star
	Stayed here about a month ago.  This was really a great hotel.  It's very classic feel, but with brand new bedding, TV, and bathrooms so no old dirty feeling in the rooms.  The employees were super nice, I found a good rate online making it a bargain for downtown.  This is where I'll stay next time I'm in Charlotte.	4 star
	First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying.	4 star
	Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.\n\nMy dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o)	3 star
	As much as it was mentioned in every single tourist guide i could find of Charlotte, this is a homey, family restaurant with soul and a great vibe to it, NOT a tourist-magnet in any way shape of form. The people that work there were down-to-earth and friendly to the core. The service was swift, the mood great, the food delicious. What else to say? Love that place!\n\n\nTIP: Try their fried pickles! Oh my sweet goodness... best culinary surprise I've experienced in years. I was dying to order a second round of them because... wow... they were so good.	3 star
	A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  \n\nLast time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood.	3 star
	For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for. \n\nThe only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.	1 star
	Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers.	3 star
	Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!	1 star
	Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!	0 star
	I only gave them 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Food was mediocre (fries were cold), and we haven't seen our waitress in 45 minutes (writing this review while waiting to ask for the check). I'll write another review tomorrow if I'm still here waiting.	0 star
	not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.	2 star
	The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.	1 star
	one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \"asian\"	3 star
	with a name like presto, i was expecting italian food.\n\ni stayed in charlotte, nc for a week and in a small walk from my hotel room discovered presto.  i had a garden salad which was accompanied by an entire loaf of bread on it's own mini cutting board, and the seafood jambalaya. everything was delicious. there was plenty of shrimp and large scallops in my jambalaya, the bread came with a plate of olive oil and herbs, and the salad's balsamic vinaigrette dressing wasn't too heavy.\n\nnext time i fly out to charlotte i'll most likely eat at presto again.	3 star
	This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome.	2 star
	Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.	2 star
	You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back.	0 star
	TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \"promotion\" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!	0 star
	I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all.	1 star
	A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.	1 star
	After having an awful, overpriced breakfast at the Courtyard Marriott - Charlotte City Center the morning before, I consulted Yelp to find a place within walking distance that wouldn't give me indigestion.\n\nI recommend the eggs benedict at the Monticell ($9). The eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was nicely seasoned and the cheese grits were a tasty side.\n\nThe service could have been a bit more attentive, and it's not cheap, but I would recommend the Monticello to anyone looking for a good breakfast in this part of Charlotte.	3 star
	Hit up merts for dinner last night..  Had the Fried catfish and Beef rib combo.  Whole fried catfish was a little tough to negociate the bones and didnt not yeald much fish. \"The beef rib\" was chopped up and in a small pile bones and all.  Like other have said the goodness in in the sides..  Mac and Cheese was real and had a nice crust on the top and the corn bread was good.. athough the piece my wife got looked like it was in the oven a littlel too long and dried out a bit.  Overall decent stop	2 star
	Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \n\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.	2 star
	I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.	3 star
	Thank you Yelp!  We were in town visiting and decided to try this place for lunch based on its good reviews.  Yelpers were right on - delicious (and affordable)!  We loved the cornbread, candied yams, collard greens, carolina chopped bbq, mac & cheese, green beans, and black eyed peas.  Generous portions too.  Full of atmosphere and it was still busy at 3pm.  \n\nWe definitely recommend Mert's.	4 star
	I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.	1 star
	Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off.	1 star
	Delicious Southern food!\n\nThe cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.\n\nPrices are decent, and the service is good.\n\nParking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking.	3 star
	Another big soul food spot downtown. If you are looking for chicken, ribs, and other down south delights you are in the right place. The restaurant Is on the small side so there is usually await. But the cornbread is defiantly worth the wait outside if the door. I usually get the fried chicken wings and Mac and cheese.\n\nGood spot to grab dinner, casual, will fill you up.	2 star
	Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking.	1 star
	Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection, but it was so crowded the service was not great.	2 star
	I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!	4 star
	Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.	1 star
	The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that, this place is grimy, creepy, and nasty.  I would suggest trying one of the other Fuels outside of the city.. Trust me.  \n\n-Ian M.	1 star
	Ok im not going to say that i dont love coming here. The service is great, the ambience phenomenal, the manager is actually italian, etc. I love coming here for dinners or just a bite at the bar, but like with the rest of cuisine in Charlotte, its just not awesome. I believe its because the water in CLT sucks. \n\nGrilled octopus is the best thing on the menu. Hands down	3 star
	My wife and I went last night for a \"date night\" and were very pleased. Very romantic, quiet, well-decorated. The bar was comfortable and they had a great selection and service (friendly but not too chatty). The staff was overall what really made this experience so good. Every person was friendly, knowledgable, and fun. The dinner was very good although we didn't care too much for the flash-fried calamari. \n\nWe would absolutely recommend this wonderful restaurant and will be coming back.	4 star
	Until Del Frisco showed up, best steak and best wine list in town!!!  Now...it's a toss up.  Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  Go light on the app's, everyone...the steaks are ridiculously large.  They've got one of those wine lists that is made for every single person that can walk through that door...great whites and great reds...excellence whether you're staying under 20 bucks, or if you're budget is big time.  Also, the bar out front is a great place to enjoy some happy hour and watch the cougars on the prowl...fun people watching.	4 star
	The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.	4 star
	Must say that Bulleit Burbon is very hard to find and this place had it.  SCORE!! Dark leather, dark wood, great conversation areas, lots of cigar smoke and great service.  Didn't have to buy a cigar, the place was a blue-grey haze of smoke.   \n\nKind of wonky getting into the place.  It's not really in the hotel but it is.  You have to walk in the breezeway before the lobby.  Door is a bit unexpected, but not hidden.  Not their fault, but in a sense it adds to the ambiance.	4 star
	Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work.	0 star
	A well kept secret! If you are looking for wine treats, you have to check this out. It is like a little wine store located right inside the department store. They do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff.. I have only just peeked through the glass, but YUM!	4 star
	Great Turkey Grinder!	3 star
	The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier.	3 star
	I am not sure why SF folks have a problem with Charlotte restaurants but maybe they should give Zebra's, Barrington's, Bonterro or Nobles a try prior to giving up on Charlotte.\nLavecchia's is a bit noisy once it gets crowded but the seafood is pretty good (yes Upstream is better, but a bit new something for my taste). Try the their version of  Oysters Rockefeller  (not authentic but very tasty). Plus they have free parking in the building.	3 star
	This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.\n\nI usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun.	3 star
	Drink prices are high but the dancing is fun!	2 star
	this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.	3 star
	Trendy-looking on the inside, which immediately ups the cool factor.  An ex-boyfriend took me here on a date and we enjoyed it.  I liked all the food we had except the foie gras; not necessarily the restaurant's fault, I just didn't like the texture.  I didn't want it, but Brian let me have a bite.  The wine sampler with dessert was a lot of fun.  The service was great....I'm just not sure it was worth the price.	2 star
	I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight.	1 star
	I went in here when I had some time to kill while a watch was being fixed, and really liked it.  The layout was a little tough to figure out at first - hard to know if a book would be in new releases, fiction, bestsellers, etc.  but the staff is very helpful.  They also have great cards, journals and other gifts.  I love that they have a big jigsaw puzzle on a table with chairs around it if you want to sit down and work on it while someone else is shopping.	3 star
	Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.	1 star
	Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.	3 star
	I will never go here again. Last Saturday, I paid for my ticket and headed in. Unfortunately, after waiting nearly two hours for the Nighthawk, it was put out of service, as were some others in the park that day. This has happened to me several times at Carowinds and I really don't understand how their coasters malfunction daily, sometimes multiple times. After purchasing a ticket, I literally got to ride one ride, for which I also waited over an hour. And of course their were no refunds even though it was their issue.	0 star
	We went this past Sun and overall had a great time. My only issue, and why I'm on Yelp, is the food. Just horrible and way, way, way overpriced.\nI would suggest spend the extra $10 for preferred parking and bring a cooler. Don't buy any food in the park. Out of desperation my sons a I had 2 slices with 2 breadsticks. Survey says-I've had MREs that tasted better.\n                              Oh yeah, $14 by the way.\nPreferred parking is only $10. Bring your own chow and have a great time.	2 star
	Small park, over priced food, we paid $55 for 3 slices of pizza , 2 orders of chicken wings that were the smallest flavorless wings we have ever had, and 2 beers.....never again....pack food	2 star
	It's Carowinds. Some good rides. Most surrounded by stuff you won't ride or games you won't waste money on. The kids will have fun, no doubt. The people are nice enough. The group hospitality is very good with great brisket and chicken. They make you feel welcome. Just enjoy it.	2 star
	If you have been to Disney or even Chi-fil-a this place will disappoint you with their horrible customer service. Perhaps when 80% of your staff are 18 yrs and younger you need to instill respect, courtesy and the customer is always right b/c they just dropped a freakin mini fortune on this crappy amusement park that post hours of operations for stores and restaurants as suggested times. And you only get 1 star because I couldn't leave it blank	0 star
	Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.	0 star
	This ymca is very large.  It has 4 floors to exercise.  Like 10 racket ball rooms.  Towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc.  The downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown.	3 star
	They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed, they don't have a great selection, the decor is predictable (although they do have a nice set of high tables) and the lighting is a bit weird. It is a good place to have a good conversation though - just be warned, it might leave you feeling blue too.	2 star
	I went on a Saturday at lunch not very busy ... Friday I went by for lunch and it was busy with the downtown office people. Service and food was great... got the dragon and volcano rolls very good! And tasty fried dumplings... if I ever find myself in Charlotte again I will return.	3 star
	I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \"b+\" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice.	3 star
	Solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with. Sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary.	2 star
	Great venue for a wedding - I attended a couple of weddings here and the chapel is very quaint.  If you like historic little places with lots of character and don't want to get married in an actual church, this is a great option. It is also centrally located between midtown & uptown districts, which is nice if you have people coming from out of town or simply from different sides of town. There is a beautiful garden outdoors with lots of trees and a sweet little gazebo which is perfect for those wedding photos.	3 star
	Adams 7th St Market is a great deli on the corner of Hawthorne and 7th St.  They have excellent sandwiches, soups and pastas.  You can get a sandwich \"roll\" (medium sized) or hero (large sized).  I opted for a honey turkey club and found the roll size to be just right.  This particular sandwich was delicious: loaded with honey turkey, coleslaw and bacon.  I also enjoyed a side of pesto pasta salad - there were quite a few sides to choose from.  Prices are moderate, service was very quick, and the interior was comfortable and clean.  Highly recommended for lunch!	3 star
	Food was really good and they have a great wine selection.  I will say we got there at 6:45 and the place was already packed full and the bar too.  Had to stand around for a bit.  Just my husband and I so we have some wine, waited for our table and had a really good time just of the two of us.  Great for date night, little crazy with a group of people.	3 star
	For the first time ever I ate at mama ricotta's tonight with my family, I went because my cousin told me it was good.  We ate family style and it was pretty good, I wasn't a fan of the caesar salad because the dressing taste like a tangy mayo.  Other than that it was pretty tasty food.  The service was excellent, our waitress was really nice and very promp.  We were in and out really fast, the longest wait we had was to be seated and that was about 10 minutes or so.	2 star
	Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.	0 star
	One of my favorites.  The food and service are always excellent.   Whatever you have, ending with the bread pudding (not listed on the menu) and the tiramisu are a must!!!!	3 star
	Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!	1 star
	I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!	4 star
	Best sushi I have had in Charlotte!	4 star
	Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant.	3 star
	They serve THE BEST roti canai!! MUST EAT!! Highly recommendeddddddddddddddddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	4 star
	Who knew that Charlotte would have some of the biggest and well-stocked comic book stores, I've ever seen?\n\nHeroes is well-located, with a floor layout that makes sense. Open, inviting, bright and cheery, with a friendly staff that is neither too geeky or cool.  Massive amounts of comics, a smaller collection of figures; you can peruse until your heart's content.\n\nI'm not a hardcore comic book fan, but I love checking them out.  What I enjoy about Heroes is that it's environment that is welcoming to both intense enthusiasts and also passerbys.	3 star
	I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on!	0 star
	My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend.	4 star
	Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either.	1 star
	Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite Chinese. \n\nMy criteria for picking Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce\n\n....This place does it just right - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely not upscale!) - nice crispy/ light chicken complete with  pretty good although not super memorable side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me though, personally they have the crispy chicken nailed - so Im in!	4 star
	Nothing special.  Went during winter, and while they still served frozen yogurt, I didn't get a chance to try it.  The rest of the foods were basic concession-stand items.  Burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, etc.  Would probably be nice for a visit in the summer, but not exactly a lunch destination.	2 star
	Decent food.  No desire to go back for a second try.  Salad was good but the fried chicken is very bland.  I don't know why the place is supposedly known for fried chicken but it does not even break my top 10 for fried chicken.  I'm from the south and know fried chicken.  It was tender but very, very bland.	2 star
	Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \n\nThe Service is always good and friendly!	3 star
	One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake.	4 star
	What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)	4 star
	Interesting concept, having a restaurant in a kind of living family house, but that is common for the upscale Elisabeth area in Charlotte. Very good food, not quite Southern as in Louisiana but very close. Very friendly staff and quick service. Had to visist my hometown to go there, shame on me since I lived 5 years in Charlotte and never went eating there. We had a great time and can recommend it to everyone!	4 star
	The fried oysters are to die for.\n\nThe crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlicky.\n\nThe BBQ shrimp is just a-ok.\n\nReal cool how they turned an old house into CQ.	2 star
	The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.	4 star
	Yes I love Burger King. Yes I know its terrible for me. No I will not stop coming here. \n\nI love this location, even though someone was shot in the face here not too long ago, I still can not stay away. I love the fact that I can go through the drive-thru and not have to worry about checking my bag for the right items because they have never messed up one order of mine. And that is pretty damn rare for fast food.\n\nOther than that typical BK fare.	2 star
	All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here, you may need to be patient. I took me about 3 months to get in to see her, but was well worth the wait.	4 star
	The rocking chairs are genius!\n\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\n\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \n\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \n\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20.	4 star
	Free WiFi everywhere in the airport!\n\nCute rocking chairs in the main lobby. \n\nA few small shops.\n\nMostly fast food restaurants. The non-fast food restaurants are spread pretty far and wide. \n\nIt's a pretty good hike between concourses but there are walking sidewalks in places. \n\nOverall, it's an ok transfer point. Pack a lunch and sit a spell in the rocking chairs until your next flight.	2 star
	Wonderful food and shopping available, but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips?  This isn't a European nightclub.	2 star
	Busy and confusing. It's a nice and large open space filled with many escalators and walking escalators. The people are friendly and do try their best to help. Every terminal/section has a special desk where people who have missed their flights can go to rebook and/or get on standby flights. Unfortunately, the customer service desks cannot handle situations where there is a large number of people who need help. The lines can get absolutely ridiculous!! \n\nOverall, a relatively comfortable area (for an airport) with plenty of food options.	2 star
	Very nice airport if you have time to loiter before you flight.  Free Wi-Fi, nice rocking chairs, decent restaurant selections, good shops.  BUT, this airport is NOT made for those with tight connections.  Its spider layout makes it problematic if you get in at a high B gate and have an E gate departure.  RUN don't walk if you have less than 20 minutes to board your next flight.  You may even want to wear a pair of Depends so you can just soil yourself to save time.  I also think it's awkward having bathroom attendants.	2 star
	Had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. Customs wasn't too bad, basically waved us through. But we had to exit to the main terminal and re-go thru security, which is freaking insane! We had an 80 minute lay over and I think we only got to the plane with 20 minutes to spare - they were already boarding. ugh!	1 star
	Pretty efficient as far as airports go. Usually an hour preflight is good depending on where you're going. I generally fly us airways and have never encountered a problem with anything. Smooth lines for security and I recommend going through the d/e checkpoint as it almost always seems to be less congested and quicker than it's counterparts!  Happy flying :)	2 star
	I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.	2 star
	@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!	1 star
	I connected through CLT on a recent trip. I have to say, as a former resident of the Charlotte area, and after experiencing the ease of my home airport (Dallas-Fort Worth Int'l), this airport could be so much better.\n\nIt seems that CLT just keeps building on to itself and is making itself bigger and stretched so far that it is now a chore to have a connecting flight there.	1 star
	As a North Carolina native now living in DC, I come through Charlotte Douglas pretty frequently.  I've never had a problem in this airport, but don't like the hub and spoke layout.  If you land in one Terminal and have to get to another quickly, you better pick up the pace, as there is no train between terminals.  There's plenty of shopping, restaurants, and bars, but the layout makes it less than convenient to get to what you want.	2 star
	Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service.	3 star
	Huge airport.  Clean and lots of shopping.	2 star
	One of the best US Airways hub airports.	2 star
	This is what a NYC airport should look like. It's \nchic and they have a wine bar!!! Why would a North Carolina airport have a \nchic wine bar. I thought i would land at a crappy run down airport like LaGuardia airport but to my surprise the south is more modern than NYC??? odd. NYC get with it!!!!!!	3 star
	Whenever I'm booking a flight that requires a connection (which, let's be real, is almost always the case from RIC) and Charlotte appears as an option, I take it. It's easy to navigate, isn't overwhelming and offers standard food options as well as a few of my traveling faves. Jamba Juice, Pinkberry, TCBY? Yes, please!\n\nIt even boasts rocking chairs (welcome to the South, y'all) and free wi-fi. Doesn't get much better than that during a layover.	3 star
	They are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals.  Easy peasy airport.  The food options are lacking, but I imagine they will fix that eventually.  How about some of that well known NC BBQ in the terminals??	2 star
	Decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  Be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it.	3 star
	It's an airport, small but had what it needed. Planes.	2 star
	Actually this is one of my favorite airports. I like the fact that there are rocking chairs in all the terminals for use by weary passengers. The food selection in the main area is not bad as well as some of the offerings in the different terminals. Flights are usually pretty much on time unless there is a major thunderstorm passing through the area.\n\nI chose to travel on an airline other than USAIR, which \"owns\" this place, and everything went quite well. The airport is very clean and everyone is courteous. Not a bad place to spend time between flights.	3 star
	Standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs.	2 star
	I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!	4 star
	CLT used to be better, but their passenger volume has increased significantly. I used to fly out of here as my main airport from 2005-2010, but have since moved away and just returned back. \n\nIt is moderately-sized and laid out well, with well-placed maps throughout the terminal. There is also a decent selection of restaurants.\n\nThe downside that I found on my recent trip is that volume is up heavily and there is not enough room to accommodate the additional passengers. The hallways were packed and there were no empty seats to be found.\n\nEven the U.S. Airways lounge was crowded.	2 star
	Charlotte has grown I remember when the airport was small now it's like a little city of it's own. I don't mind waiting for a plane here as they have plenty of places to eat and pass time. They made it look real nice and \"purdee\" inside so you feel like you're in a nice place unlike Newark or JFK which are boring as hell to me. I don't think the majority of passengers will be disappointed passing through here.	3 star
	I really enjoyed my time here and the kids I brought song enjoyed it too! There are some planes that you can get inside of and volunteers to explain it all to you. The volunteers were so helpful! We were able to watch a plan take off from the airport. So cool! I really wish they had a restaurant for lunch. But other than that I really enjoyed the museum.	3 star
	Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful.	3 star
	I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.	0 star
	If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  \n\nGot the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  \n\nSummary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again.	1 star
	Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast.	1 star
	This place is truly hit and miss... The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location,being 2 stories, and the piano is awesome but it is mcdonalds keep in mind so the food can only be so good even if it's hot and \"fresh\" \n\nEat here at your own risk and since they close at midnight this isn't a drunk food spot	1 star
	Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends.	3 star
	Let me tell you gents this place is totes av (average). Really not much to say. If you like food you'll probably be able to eat some of it here. My friends at the table insist that I rate this place as \"good average\" but that seems meaningless. Also $2 beers of which I've had about 6.	1 star
	This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.	1 star
	I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!	3 star
	I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices.	3 star
	It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!	3 star
	The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.	0 star
	After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!	2 star
	This has always been awesome place on my list of places to shop or have a sandwich went recently and had a fantastic lunch.	4 star
	Wow.\n\nSo-so Chinese food for twice the price.\n\nNo wonder, it's a chain restaurant. Hey, they sell their food in the frozen food department at the grocery store, too. It might be the same quality. That may or may not be sad depending on the consumer. Is it that good from the freezer? Do they just microwave one of those bad boys in the restaurant?\n\nThe prices might be worth it for dinner but lunch? Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter	1 star
	My husband and I went grocery shopping here on a  Monday evening... bad idea. The shelves were almost bare and what was left was a mess and disorganized. This is unusual for this store, which I usually shop at. Positive for this trip was as usual the salad bar and the tomato bisque soup. A must try!	2 star
	I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...\n\nWhen I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.\n\nPersonally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.\n\nThe soup is always great.  The service is also nice.	3 star
	Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!	4 star
	Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much, maybe I am an exception.  I like the wine suggestion it was top notch.  Staff was efficient and friendly.	2 star
	Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. \n\nService was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. \n\nIt is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any.	1 star
	Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow, 45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress.  Once at our table, we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table.  Waiter served the entrees and walked away, never checked to see how our meal was.  While tasty, the portions are small.\n\nUnfortunately, the best part of this restaurant is the valet service.  Don't frustrate yourself, dine elsewhere with friends.	0 star
	Thought we'd try Showmars; they are convenient. You place order at the counter and then find a table. Plenty tables available but every one was sticky. I don't consider a table top that holds on to you to be clean. \n\nFood was served quickly and is okay. Nothing slid off the table...	2 star
	A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.	0 star
	After being prodded and pocked by my co-workers to get a kitchen pass, I finally went to the Flying Saucer.\nI get the concept.  I appreciate the effort but come on.... shouldn't you look good in a skimpy outfit if you are going to wear one?  I did not really expect great service and that was pretty clear.  Friendly enough but the overall IQ was rather low.\nI do give a huge nod to the beer selection and for that one reason I am likely to go back.	1 star
	Great beer selection, great atmosphere, great bartenders. What more can I say? Perfect for someone wanting to enjoy a beer with good friends. Monday night is the night for great specials but I prefer to go the other nights of the week when The Saucer is a bit quieter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is has nothing good to say about Charlotte night life, this will certainly change your mind. Give the fresh pretzels with queso a try!	3 star
	I always come here after playing a round of Par 3 golf next door.  How can you go wrong with hundreds of beers, pretty girls and descent bar food?  You can't!  Cool spot - check it out!	3 star
	Good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street. ~Cheers	3 star
	Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.	2 star
	Hertz here is awful, worst I've ever seen.  50 people in line, four behind the counter.  Don't\nSeem to care...line is longer than my flight!!  Buses keep delivering people.  Could it be that it's a surprise that a lot of people show up at 2:00, wanting to pick up cars they paid for.  Cost is not worth this aggravation, I beg you to go somewhere else ....again, worst I have ever seen.	0 star
	Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant.	4 star
	I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice.	3 star
	I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.	1 star
	I was told the burgers where great here......well last night we gave them a try.   I was not impressed.  We order two jumbo cheeseburgers one with fries, the other with onion rings.  The burgers where BURNT to a crisp.  All the favor of the meat was gone. On a good note the onion rings where great.   Please don't burn the burgers.	0 star
	Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got.	2 star
	Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?	2 star

	this place never disappoints me. Tough to get in, reservations are a must but always delicious.	4 star
	This UPS store shares its main entrance with the Caribou Coffee. They are a full service mailing shop, with boxes, packing materials and yes, they ship stuff by UPS. I think they also have a mailbox system, but I wasn't really paying attention. I just wanted to drop off my pre-paid package and be on my way. The clerk was friendly and helpful and got it done pronto. If I have more UPS mailing requirements, I'll be back.	2 star
	Everything really is a dollar (though some things are two for a dollar). I thought I might take a browse and see what there was and I was amazed. I somehow managed to pick up $7 worth of stuff that I actually needed for my place. Stuff that would have been twice or three times the price at the local Wal-Mart.\n\nIf you're looking to save a few bucks, Dollar Tree rocks!	2 star
	This is a very busy dollar store. No matter what time I go in there is always a line at the cashiers station. \n\nThis location has a good variety of merchandise, but the shelves (because they are so busy) are never fully stocked. \n\nThe employees definitely make this place 3.5 stars. I think they are always friendly, even with a line wrapped around to the door. They try their best even without a lot of extra help, and that's pretty much all you can ask for from your cashier.	2 star
	Sigh...to be honest, there is just no good food option in this shopping center. This Mccalister falls short just like many mccalisters. The lighting in here is kind of dark. The food...it lacks flavor. Don't come here if you want a good sandwich, which is funny because it is a deli. The typical scene you can expect is you come in, order with one of the high schooler staff up front and retrieve your food when it's ready at the counter. So-so food...ok price here for what you get.	2 star
	You would think fried chicken would be simple... Absolutely horrible.  A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool, go during the day, otherwise, stay clear!!!\nPS: I had to remind them of the \"drink\" to get it removed from the bill.	1 star
	Very good food and I like the atmosphere and style. Maybe it is a little 80'ish looking on the design, but who doesn't love a place where you are taken back Miami Vice and shoulder pads in your leather jacket. \nThe food is very good an I've tried a variety of things without being disappointed. Oven backed pizzas are good, shrimp and grits ok but I've had better. The baked Alaskan (I thought it was fish when my fianc\u00e9 ordered it) is a wonderful dessert but only available certain times of the year.	3 star
	We eat at trio nearly twice a week. The menu has various different items and everything is good. I love the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die for. Trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get. Most dishes are under 12.00. The service is good as well.	4 star
	Casual dinner with members tonight and food was great! Service was inexperienced.  Always love the location and people!	2 star
	Not my favorite experience at a Japanese Steakhouse. My food was good-- not phenomenal, but good. My waiter was relatively inattentive (and spoke limited English), and thus, got my order wrong; thankfully, everything is made in front of you, so this was fixed and I enjoyed my filet and lobster as ordered. That stated, this place is just too loud (and I'm eighteen, so that says a lot), and the service feels rushed.\n\nMy suggestion? Go to the Nakato down the road.	2 star
	I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better. The service wasn't bad, and the presentation was typical. Just nothing special. I have no specific complaints, but nothing to brag about or remember, either.	1 star
	Extremely dissapointing trip here. Service was average to bad. Food quality left a lot to be improved. Currys have no meat but curry. Taste wise it isn't great either. I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere,seems like they don't vacuum at all or very little.	1 star
	They have awesome Iced Thai Tea!! ( If you haven't tried one then you should go get one) Love their dishes, which are delish! And you should tried the fried duck ( I don't remember the name, just the details) they're yummy too! And their staffs are nice too. So it a great place to go when you want any Thai foods. :)	4 star
	I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok.	0 star
	The food is inexpensive. I was there with co workers for lunch. Service was not good and we noticed after we were done eating that there were bugs crawling on the table. When we told the checkout person that there were bugs on the table her response was \"oh they start coming out after we spray.\"  Will not go back, between the service and the bugs I am totally grossed out!	0 star
	The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty.	2 star
	I went to Salsa's/Cabo's for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  The fresh-made tortillas were wonderful and the service was excellent, but the food was just ok for me.   There was a good selection of items and everything was tasty, but some items were a bit too salty for my taste.   I may give it another try.	2 star
	Like K.B. said, its pretty standard mexican food.  I thought the salsa before the meal was too watery.  I had the fish tacos.  The fish was fried.  This place is ok if your in the area and hungry.  You won't be thrilled or disappointed.	2 star
	I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.	1 star

	Went to this Applebee's location two times. The first time was a few years back, and the bartender had terrible customer service (I'm not sure if she still works there, but I think it's worth noting). The second time I went, my girlfriend specifically asked for no onions on her sliders, and they came out with onions anyway. Also, my second round of sangria tasted like the bartender poured half a bottle of what ever they use to sweeten it, and barely any wine. I'll stick to the location by concord mills mall	1 star
	A warm fall day. Sun is shining. A slight breeze...\n\nTo the Wine Vault! They have a vast collection to choose from. By the bottle or glass. And great outdoor seating to take in the fresh air. They don't have a kitchen, but have some pretty good munchies. \n\nIf you don't like wine, they do have bottled beer in the back. Seasonal selection too.\n\nA nice atmosphere but a little pricey. But with good company, it can be very enjoyable. \n\nTip: wed 7pm tastings..	3 star

	Sam's, my go to store your snacks, awesome find s, and bulk items! The prices are pretty good. I get certain things and I get out, before I spend unnecessary money. That is very easy to do! Its kind of like a larger Walmart, and a foodies paradise! If you haven't been. GO NOW! ENJOY! \n\nOh, by the way, their pizza is delicious at the hot bar, up front, and they sell whole pizzas hot at the bar, and slices. In the  deli area in the back, they sell the same whole pizzas, except they are cold.	4 star
	Terrible. Ugly d\u00e9cor, bad food, poor service.	0 star
	This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread.	0 star
	The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!	0 star

	Surprisingly, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious!\n\nGrilled Chicken Salad - good enough\n\nSpud Max - great! I would definitely get this again.  The Spud Max includes: bacon, cheddar cheese, scallions, and ham.  Add sour cream, and I am in heaven!	3 star
	I give this place zero stars.  I went in for a pedicure and not only did I wait for about 10 minutes (with my feet in the water) for the girl to finish eating her lunch, she cut the hell out of my cuticle.  It took over 15 minutes to stop the bleeding and then when I asked to be comped for it, all they have me was $2 off.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy.  I know I will never be back here.	0 star

	Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at, cursed at, watched ppl get punched, and had a very good cheeseburger at the same time. It was a lot of fun. The burger was really good for a grill & the homemade chips were off the charts! The grill was filled with men who enjoyed being yelled at by the female owner! Good times & good food! Don't take young kids	3 star
	Don't you love it when you have to beg the restaurant to put food out on a buffet? Whenever I go here, the place is decently busy but they always seem to have a problem with having enough food out on their buffet. Everytime a tray of food is brought out, it's such a tiny portion that its usually emptied out within seconds by all the hungry customers! If you're going to run a buffet and expect people to come back, AT LEAST have enough food there for your paying customers!	1 star

	4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the taste.\n\nThe big wasn't that big, it was normal size to me.  Lots of choices for one price, which was awesome.  6 different meats, lots of topping choices.  And yea, the service was really good.\n\nThe taste?  Just not there.  The rice wasn't flavorful, the steak had a hint of flavor even though they were generous with it...I didn't put sour cream/cheese on there, but they are generally masking agents - what doesn't taste good with those 2 ingredients????	2 star
	Not good! Really, not good. I had lunch here. I was so disappointed. The crab rangoon, had no crab, just a scant amount of filling.  My lunch consisteted of a neon orange rice. Strange looking, and bad tasting. The food was so bad, I thought we were being pranked.	0 star

	Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it... Don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed..	4 star
	For being surrounded by two lakes, Madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water. Head down to McFarland and check out the beach house. It's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake. Tons of windows. Not a bad place.\n\nCan't comment on the food. Drink specials were solid.	3 star
	This place has good steaks,and fish fry. I also like the saturday special bacon wrapped filet, with lobster tail,all for 24.99 I think? All the dinners come with soup or salad, potato choic,warm rolls w/ butter. Walleye,cod,bluegill are all delecious. Good place for a beer as well. Great view, and drink specials. This is a real Sconnie place,Wisco to the core. My fave Fish Fry spot for sure.	3 star
	We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp.  If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it.  I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor.  The fish deserves 5 stars.  Everything else a 3 star.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Would definitely go back.	2 star
	Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead.	0 star
	From scratch pastries, breads, breakfast, lunch, dinner options\nCozy coffee shop atmosphere, fireplace, plenty of tables.\nCash only. Pay at front and they will bring the food out to you.\nFree refills on coffee.\nNever dissapointed.	3 star
	As always excellent, locally sourced food.	3 star
	We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.	0 star

	First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.	1 star
	Told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. They looked around and said ,\"nope, take the belt back and ask for a new one under warranty\".. Charged be $12, and after installing a new belt, turns out they were right. Honest guys.	4 star
	Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass, described my needs, and received a prompt response with a quote (within a couple hours). \n\nEasy pick up during regular business hours. I was showed how to use the equipment and it was loaded into my car. Equipment was easy to set up during our event and the sound quality was great! Quick and simple return. Will definitely use them again!	4 star
	Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.\nIt was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.\nI don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night.  \nLunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  \nDon't go looking for the lobster.  Go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!	3 star
	Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.	4 star
	Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere	2 star
	Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return.	3 star
	The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick.	0 star
	Update: 8/26/12\n\n8:30 A.M. Hangover. Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings. Drive-thru. Had to pull ahead and wait. 21 minutes later, a woman in a purple velvet one piece delivered our food. Don't they have work uniforms here? Jeeez.	0 star
	Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.	1 star
	I love the root beer ! Service and atmosphere was cafeteria-like, food was average. Chicken strips and cheese curds were good.	2 star
	Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!	4 star
	Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion, if you like sweet taste this much, might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal. When I ordered my food a few years back from them, they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow. It was not appealing to me. But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better. I sure hope that's the case.	1 star
	Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave	0 star
	terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.	0 star
	Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle.	0 star
	Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos.	1 star
	We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.	0 star
	Grade: C\n\nChain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.	2 star
	It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.	3 star
	A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.	0 star
	It took them two washes and a visit with the owner to get it partially right.\nThe owner thinks the only way to dry windows and windshields is with a wet cloth.\nI couldn't convince the owner of using dry cloths.\nI won't go back - The guy is brusque, and not ethical.  \nThey have hardly any business - I wonder why?\nThey will be out of business soon.\n\nGo to OCTOPUS for the BEST WASH.	0 star
	Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan.	1 star
	Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.\nThey don't biast 30	3 star
	Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food.  I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place.	1 star
	I like Monty's food--breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all very good--but I just can't help thinking that it's overpriced when I go there.  It seems like it should be diner-priced . . . but almost $9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me.  Their desserts are to die for, though.	2 star
	Yucky greasy food.	0 star
	Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious.	3 star
	What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through.	3 star
	Amazing is all I can say. They have absolutely everything. No, it's not organic but it's super homemade and killer. I get something different every time I am there and have yet to be disappointed. All the brats, beef, chicken, BACON are all wonderful. Support local butchers or they will disappear! Perfect example, I went in and asked for a pound of italian sausage (kale/cauliflower/sausage pot pie, yum!) and they were out but they offered to make me some on the spot. Really amazing service and great product quality. Make the trip to Jim's	3 star
	Slightly lower than average Hampton Inn.  Heat/AC wasn't updated, pretty typical besides that.	2 star
	I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \"like a virgin\" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\n\nClassy.	2 star
	I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often.  They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks.  Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip, as if the person buying the food is responsible for the shitty wage the store pays or the tacked on fee that apparently does not actually support delivery) but they are usually less.	2 star
	I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place.	0 star
	N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.	4 star
	Had a lot of fun at a Mallards game recently.  Food and beer are top-notch in both prices and quality.  Front-row seats along the basepaths are a bit narrow and claustrophobic; it seems like they sacrificed about 3-4 inches of legroom compared to other rows.  People were friendly, but the all-out assault on buying raffle tickets and everything when you walk in the park is a bit much.  Loved the between-inning games and promos.	3 star
	Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.	4 star
	Pretty impressive landscaping, floral and fauna display. Free admission, but I suggest spending the extra $2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds.	3 star
	Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.\n\nSorry, Pizza Pit staff. \n\n[Cue the Tim & Eric \"Ya blew it!\" .gif.]	0 star

	Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!	1 star

	Best BBQ in Madison.  Hands down.  Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south.	3 star
	Great BBQ!\nIt's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ.\nI don't remember seeing any highchairs.  We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in.\nWhile you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks.\nNo alcoholic beverages... (that's why 4 stars).	3 star
	The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab.	4 star
	Worst service ever.  No one cares, was lied to, wasted my time, twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN.	0 star
	You will never go away hungry...and your wallet will not be much lighter.  Good food, good prices and wonderful staff.	4 star
	Wow, this antique mall seems to go on and on forever. It is huge and has a wonderful selection of collectibles. I am in the market for collectible books and they had so many books, that I could not see them all in this trip. There are a lot of kitchen items, dishes and vintage toys. This is a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon. The prices were reasonable. There was a check in offer and some of the dealers booths have coupons.	3 star
	The Good\nLots of local food\nDelicious pre-made food options\nPretty decent bakery\n\nThe Bad\nNot a lot of options for staples\nA little hard to navigate\n\nThe Ugly\nPrice are sometimes just too high for my taste	2 star
	I had a craving for KFC. I went through the drive through and the machine was muffled terribly. The service was slow. When I got home, the food was poor quality. The mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy. Even the coleslaw was very dry. The worst was the chicken strips, which were extremely dry and nearly too hard to bite into. \n\nI returned to the location to comment the next day and the man at the counter (I assume the manager) was very rude.\n\nI would not recommend this location based on service and good quality.	0 star
	This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.\n\nHowever, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay.	2 star
	Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.	0 star
	Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!	2 star
	Wouldn't do an oil change when I came in at 5:10, the guy at the desk said they didn't have time to do it, but they only had one car in the bay. What's the point in advertising a cheap special on oil changes if you won't do it because you close only an hour after people get off work.	1 star
	The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili.	2 star
	Mediocre sushi, that is priced above what it should be at.	2 star
	Well made sushi, not expensive; always fresh.  Very friendly people and I actually like the casual decor.  They make orders out up quickly too!  Not a great place for a fancy date, but one of my favorites in Madison for the true sushi lover who isn't looking to make a big deal of their sushi dinner - they just crave solidly well done sushi.	3 star
	Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger.	1 star
	ok, so the \"not very thorough\" part i mentioned in my last review is the main problem with the subsequent visits i've paid to this place. the pedicures i've had have taken about 10 minutes, tops--very hurried and not exactly thorough. last time i went, they cut my toenails crooked to top it all off. ugh. guess my quest for a decent nail joint here in town isn't quite over.	2 star
	Stopped here on our way back form Florida... not much to choose from out here...\n\nI tried the shrimp & grits.. AWESOME!!!!  Never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here!! \nAnd try the crustless coconut cream pie... MMMM!!!\ngood attentive service.	3 star
	Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs, air filters, and other automotive bits.  They also offer a huge selection of housewares and hardware.  Also, this place is CHEAP.  \n\nOne other thing: if you're a student going to a barn dance, Farm and Fleet is your one stop shop for flannel shirts, farm boots, and enormous belt buckles.	4 star
	I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here - mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.	1 star
	Went here after a doctors appointment one day. The pizza was good. The small salad wasn't their best. The service sucked. The waitress didn't give us refills and nothing was clean. She gave us our check but never came back to take our money. My husband almost walked out after being ignored at the desk by many waitresses that still wouldn't take our money. Finally, the manager did. I will not be back because of the horrible service.	1 star
	MTD is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty.  However, the buses are often late, so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early.  At least the MTD buses are free to students.	2 star
	Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.	2 star
	Dorcas is a very standard Korean restaurant... that Koreans actually go to! The portions are substantial, soups authentic, and banchan wonderfully served. This place reminds me of cafeterias back in Seoul, and not necessary all in a good way. The interior is clearly not meant for show, and while you know what? It makes the food stand out even better!	3 star
	This place makes no qualms about itself. It is a solid Punjabi joint, creamy curries, paneer and all.  That said, it's rather lacking in spicy inspiration - both locations didn't feature any sort of kick to their curries.  However, the lunch special is all bang for your buck...I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed!  I'm glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C-U isn't a disaster, but it's nothing to write home about either!	2 star
	I would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice. The naan is really great too. I also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer, as well as the samosas. I am not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious.	4 star
	I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact.	2 star
	generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again.	2 star
	Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.	1 star

	I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.	0 star
	i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the latter (Basil Thai) is by far the worst. as one reviewer already wrote before me, this is made here with ground chicken which is tasteless, too little food, and covered in a litre of sauce/broth. WTF? the tables and chairs in this place also seem sticky... covered in some weird nasty film. in summary, two words: stay away.	0 star
	Ugh. A curry dish with barely any veggies? No, potatoes do not count. They're not green. Even some basil in this so-called  \"basil thai\" restaurant would have been nice. Curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor. However, given a choice, why go and have bad food?	0 star
	Went with a friend and got a Bento box (Salmon teriyaki).  Food was good, but the place is a bit far from campus.  I'm not a fan of Miso soup, but the rest of my meal was good.	2 star
	Overpriced just \"okay\" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint.	1 star
	I love olive garden, but this one seems to have poor service.  The only reason why I keep coming here is for the salad and breadsticks.  I went here for my birthday this past Saturday and it was probably the best service I got and it still wasn't that great.   The wait wasn't as long as usual but that could be cause it's summer.  I wish they let us enjoy our salad longer, but that's probably cause they don't want us to eat several bowls of it cause it's unlimited	2 star
	I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd.	2 star
	Easy to schedule and they are the few shops that's open at weekends. \nTheir $50 special of oil change, tire rotation and wiper change is a good deal. Other than that it's pretty similar to other shops. \nLong wait sometimes. An hour wait for an oil change	2 star
	This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.	4 star
	The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \"They're fine\". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning.	0 star
	The best vintage shop in Champaign! Scott and Amanda are always up for a chat about mid-century furniture, and are lovely people.\n\nFurniture Lounge is simply the best shop to go to if:\n\n* you are redesigning your home and need furnishings, lighting, decor\n* you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative\n* you love thrifting, antiques, or vintage\n* you love mid century modern design\n* you want to look at something interesting and beautiful!\n\nThey recently started taking credit via Square reader in their new downtown Champaign location.	4 star
	Love crepes! I've always eaten them as desserts with chocolate and banana nutella. I've been to Paris twice and make a point to eat them when I'm there, but these are pretty amazing! The lunch crepes are great, and you can even build your own. A lot of people complain about the price but I htink the ingredients are stellar and worth every penny. Not to mention, I love that you can see the kitchen, and the place is really cute and quaint. I definitely recommend at least trying it out!	3 star
	Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\n\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\n\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.	3 star
	I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.	1 star
	I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$.	1 star
	It's closed!  Thank goodness!\n\nI was hear once with some girl friends and a couple of guys started chatting us up.  During the conversation one of them started to look really ill, they were both obviously drunk, and before we knew it the ill-looking one was vomiting in the corner of our table.  It was disgusting.  \nWe immediately notified the bartender who then mopped up the vomit with a dirty looking rag and declared the table good as new for incoming patrons.  Needless to say, we warned the next people who attempted to sit there.	0 star
	I'd say this place is pretty hipster.\nNot just \"alternative,\" like all the edgy people you can muster in CU come here - it has a real hipster attitude.\n\nBut I still love it.\nAll the beers. All the liquor.\nThe excellent beer garden.\nThe good tunes.\nThe creepy room upstairs for shows.\n\nCheers!	3 star
	Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \n\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).	1 star
	Very good soup and fish dishes.	3 star
	Daily special number 1 is the way to go! It comes with half a mackerel, and a decent bowl of tofu soup. The mackerel can be dry at times though. The kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too.	3 star
	We try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town ! Be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also. A quaint Illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and  easy access. A pay parking lot is right next door.	2 star
	Ok beer selection, ok bar food (though I am a bit of a beer/food snob).  I don't mind going when a group wants to go, but not my first choice if I'm out on my own.	2 star
	This guy really knows what he is doing.  I always feel better when I leave!	4 star
	So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.\n\nWe would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \"intestine shaped like squirrel\", anyone?\n\nExcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment.	4 star
	The Tumble Inn is a no-frills sports bar on the edge of downtown Champaign - they have a bunch of TVs, a lot of domestics on tap, and there's usually a barbecue truck parked out front. I have been here on several occasions at off-peak times to watch sporting events, and each time has been thoroughly enjoyable.	4 star
	Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.	3 star
	Nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people.	2 star
	Cheap and perfectly adequate. The kind of place you order from because it's close and cheap. If you're willing to travel farther, wait longer, or spend more, go elsewhere. But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for $4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce--the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm.	1 star
	I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. \n\nThey are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me.	3 star
	This is your basic mall fast food Chinese place. Don't expect anything more than that. That's why it's 3 stars. It's good for what it is, but it's pretty  much what you'd get at other Panda locations. The thing that struck me about this little food court counter is what you can't see from the front. I used to work doing refrigeration and commercial appliance repair in the area. This particular Panda location always had the cleanest and best maintained kitchen I've seen in the CU area, and I've been in a lot of them. Color me impressed.	2 star
	Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, awesome food. This is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon. It can get a little crowded at times though.\n\nThe Thai Tempeh sandwhich is amazing, also try the cold brew coffee sometime.	4 star
	Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later.	2 star
	Their Kobe burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles on the side, and hot fries are amazing. It satisfies the \"hard-core\" hunger..making my mouth water even now. The service is straight forward, rapid and no-questions asked cooperative.\n\nThey have at least two large TV's with sports and the food network on them, it's fun to watch as you dine in. Farren's Pub is a flight of stairs down from the street level, and filled with indoor lights and good aromas. \nThey have hot tea for the non-drinker, and it's non smoking of course. Very cool place.	4 star
	I really don't get what the big deal is with this place.  I have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there, but when i went there they were nothing special.  The place as a whole is just average: the setting, the service and the food.  This place is over rated.	1 star
	I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.	3 star
	Update - finally went to the new Lincoln Square Mall location. The decor is just awful, which is sad considering how nice the old place was. Cramped seating, depressing track lighting, drop ceilings, weird art right behind your seats so you keep bumping into it. They were out of the first two things I ordered (one was a special, so fine, but out of a basic bread-based app?)\n\nPasta took forever to come out, and my friend's was so cold that the cream sauce had congealed. Sigh.	1 star
	I've had good luck selling stuff here, but none when it comes to buying things. I just feel like everything here is either tacky, terribly made, or just an old trend. I definitely have better luck at TJ Maxx for sure.	2 star
	fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.	3 star
	I probably would have given moonstruck threeish stars when it was open, but I can't give it any stars any more because it's closed!  That seemed kind of sudden!  I wonder what happened / what is going to go in there instead.  Panera pleeeaaasssseeeee.	0 star
	This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls.  Not worth it.	0 star
	OMG! Their cookies are delicious! I had the peanut butter cookie (awesome!), rice krispy treat (delicious!), ice cream sandwich (okay...), & the sugar cookie (pretty good...).\n\nThey do accept credit cards, but only on orders that are $5 or more.	3 star
	Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)\n\nMaybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well.	1 star
	What the actual F? I just got a random text message from these people advertising some special sale on tooth crowning. Seriously? This is what modern dentistry has come to? Blasting \"sales\" for dental work via text messages? I was a patient there OVER 5 YEARS AGO. Why am I even on the spam list?\n\nShameful, absolutely shameful.	0 star
	The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.	1 star
	The better of the two Asian grocery stores on/around campus.\n\nI especially like that they have the kitchen appliances you can't find in a typical grocery store (like mini rice cookers, hot water pots, electric hot pots, etc.), and lots of random drinks, candies, snacks, etc. like a traditional store in Asia.\n\nTheir produce selection is probably smaller than Far East, but I still think you'd be able to find anything you could need here.  Plus, Am-Ko is just a much more pleasant place to shop as everything is organized well and it's just.... cleaner!	4 star
	Cheap beer, dive bar, great company, and holy crap--did everyone just eat a hojillion peanuts and dump their shells on the floor?  Really? What the hell, it's a great dive bar.  I cant' even hate on it.\n\nThe booths are big and comfy, the setting is as nonpretentious as it gets, and the peeps are chill as hell--and most likely you're not gonna run into many undergrads ;)	3 star
	Location is good, drinks are usually on the strong side...HOWEVER, the rude service you can expect to receive here, far outweigh the positives.  Every single visit to the esquire, I received unfriendly, uninviting service.  The crowd in this place is 40+ and unless you fall into this category, the staff will make you feel very unwelcome.  Every trip downtown, I want to give esquire another chance, and every time I'm disappointed.	0 star
	Excellent pizza (full disclosure: I was a cook here) and decent beer selection. The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time,  the bar space is too long and not wide enough. However, if you like pool, these are very good tables.	3 star
	worth the half off tues. guys... real cheese in those shakers. nuff said.	3 star
	I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!	4 star
	I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed.  In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic, but all they had for the lunch menu was a set of sandwiches.  Really nothing exciting at all.  Make sure you check to see what they're serving that particular day before you go for lunch.	2 star
	I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign	3 star
	By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!	4 star
	Some of the best cocktails in town. Only downside is some bartenders make them better than others. Love the mojitos! Reasonable prices. Nice decor. Nice crowd. Nice music. I went for brunch and had a lobster omelette.. I found it had a bit too many different flavors for my taste, but I'm sure others would love it, as I'm kind of picky. The guava mimosa wasn't too good though.	2 star
	Wonderful hummus and everything else, too!  Take your chances with the plate of a day, it's a bargain and an adventure!  And you'll get delightful hummus, pita, salad and rice along with the special items of the day.  The service can be a little slow since it's ONE MAN running the show but he takes his time with each person's order and serves up tasty plates!  The Arabian tea is also delish!	4 star
	Don't use this company. They don't put due dates on their bills and then get shitty with you when you don't pay your bill on time. How am I suppose to know what is ON TIME, if there is no due date. Also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile. A lot of chemicals in one pile results in DEAD grass. The technician with an 8th grade iq level didn't even bother to tell anyone. When we noticed it, we were offered a very small compensation for their incompetent workers.	0 star
	If you want to cook a steak yourself but you're too lazy to shop and put in the legwork, this is the spot for you! They charge you extra for their chef to cook it. Very much a steak and potato place. We had a mixture of filets, ribeyes and sirloins. The cuts were really good, not outstanding. Beets, bacon and eggs at the salad bar was a huge plus. Skillet cookie was top notch. The manhattan was terrible. Quality establishment.	2 star
	Amazing frozen custard. I like to stick to the basics -- vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone. The stuff is just great.	4 star
	simply fantastic, been here 4 days straight since they opened, the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits. i would go EVERY DAY.	3 star
	Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.\n\nTake your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.	3 star
	Absurd wait time. We waited in a line of ~15 people for 45 minutes. I timed the group in front of us (5 orders). It took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin' ice cream. No business this inefficient should be around. But obviously the ice cream is good.	0 star
	Who doesn't love lemon custard?  So refreshing!  And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm.  The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it!	3 star
	Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution.	0 star
	One of the more \"adult friendly\" mini-golf courses around. I disagree with other reviewers that the course is easy - I think it's rather challenging. Mostly because of small hills, and of course the dreaded waterfalls.. (getting the net to fish your ball out of the water can be a pain!) \n\nA lack of trees and shade on the course means you'll be stuck in the glaring, hot sun during the summer.. best to visit in the spring or fall when it's more comfortable. Also a plus: the course is open in the evening!	3 star
	The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value.	1 star
	Very nice place.  Good atmosphere.  We were stuck at ADEd across the street for a conference and lunch was \"on you own\".  Saw this on YELP and gave it a try.  Nice place, great view and good food.  It's a cafeteria, do not expect \"Nobou\".  For what it is, it's very nice.	3 star
	The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow.	3 star
	Ive only been here once for dinner but I go alot for lunch, I work in the area. Its always fast, sometimes gets a little busy but Ive always been able to eat and get back to work in an hour. I usually get the yellow curry or pad thai. Its good food. Not spectacular thai by any means.	3 star
	The food looked great, but unfortunately we didn't get to try it because of the wait.  \n\nThe wait, of course, doesn't deserve the two-star rating - but the service does.  We waited for almost 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the angsty teen hostess with glazed over eyes, only to be told the wait would be 45 minutes.  Lazy Thaiger.	1 star
	Safeway's are great now..  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good, fresh sushi, good sandwiches and wonderful soups... since i work in the area i eat lunch there alot and am happy with the price and selection...	3 star
	I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.	1 star
	Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.	3 star
	If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.	1 star
	Good for only one visit.  Very overpriced	1 star
	This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \n\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\n\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \n\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree.	1 star
	The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.	0 star
	Ordered a burger, and it was GREAT!  Thought it'd be a typical sports bar type burger, but it tasted pretty gourmet.  Decently priced drinks, and walking distance from the arena.  Will definitely stop by if I'm ever in the area for a sporting event again.	3 star
	I came here a couple of times while on vacation catching a few suns games and have always left happy.service is good,food is good and atmosphere is great.actually got to meet thunder Dan and do shots with him wich was pretty unreal.its a sports bar so don't come here expecting anything more than bar type food	3 star
	This is never a bad spot no matter the time of day. Seriously.	3 star
	A little pricey for the lack of amenities but the history of the hotel made it worth one night stay. \nTiny room.\nSimple bathroom.\nDid have a bar with food open late so that was great. \nI didn't get to their pool but heard it was nice.\nRoom seemed clean to me.\nGreat location! Walking distance to everything downtown.\n\nBeware! I was quoted one price on the phone but when I went to use the yelp promo they bumped it $10 bucks. Not Cool!	2 star
	This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk.	0 star
	It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well.	2 star
	AWESOME. \n\nAnd sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. \n\nBut really everything is good here.	3 star
	The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show \"Man Vs Food\" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. \nReasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer.	4 star
	This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good! \n\nThe only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.\n\nGive it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long.	3 star
	We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.	4 star
	I grew up eating Chico's Tacos (I'm not old, lol), and it's definitely one of my favorite quick Mexican food joints. The salsa bar is fantastic. I suggest the beans (no lard!), shredded beef tacos, the Achiote Chicken Salad (yum!), the cheese enchiladas....\n\nI need to add though, Management changed last year and they sadly adopted flashy, in-your-face menu boards and jacked their prices a bit. No bueno. I haven't been much since it changed but it's still good.	3 star
	Best teriyaki chicken in town!\n\nNot sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite with fat on it. Even the side salad is great, this coming from a guy who doesn't care for many things green... \n\nThe owners are extremely caring and the food shows their attention to detail!\n\nWell done!	4 star
	Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation, but after a long day of sightseeing, if you want to just sit down and get some Mexican and a few coronas without having to go back to the hotel and shower and get dressed up, this place will do. I think it's a bit more pricey then Sam's Place next door, but check the menus on line.	2 star
	So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere.	0 star
	I had the fish taco platter.  It was good and had both green and purple cabbage.  The tacos came with white rice and black beans (which I love).  I found the salsa hotter than I expected.  The tea was fresh and cold.  \n\nThe only thing I would have improved is to have more flavorful fish.  It was a bit bland.  Overall an A-OK place to eat.	2 star
	It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.	1 star
	Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!	0 star
	I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find.	0 star
	The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!  \n\nIt's a really great place for kids, especially with these little booth rooms.  The food didn't really leave an impression on me, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though, it can't all be good.	3 star
	omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table, no greeting from server. when i mentioned it to the server. she gets an attitude. food comes out, cold and unappetizing.... having to listen to a guy at the next table scream, use the f bomb every other sentence.\nmanager did bring our hot food out personally so we got to talk. this is not the place i remember to come and dine and enjoy........	0 star
	They seem to be declining over recent years but the Mizithra is so good we went back anyway.  Appetizer flatbread was fair.  Chicken parm was fair.  Mizithra was great.	2 star
	We came here for a networking event last week. The crowd (or crowding, as it were) was akin to that of a happy hour or pregame crowd. We felt squished. \n\nThe tap selection is basic, although having the Sam Adams seasonal always makes me like a place. We got to smaple some small bites of some new apps theyre working on which were good. Braised beef pappadeaux. Thats all Im saying.\n\nI may come here again, but only if its not super crowded.	2 star
	Decent burger, good salads but really high prices for the quality...probably because of the location.  Nice outdoor seating area.	1 star
	We'veeaten here on a previous trip to Phoenix, but this time we just popped in a couple of times for beers..staff are friendly, service good,  and there is a wide range of local and imported draft beer. Good place to have a rest from walking around and cool down.  Food looks good, and last time we eat here it was pretty tasty. Gets busy around then end of the working day with office workers, but nice bar.	3 star
	I found this place by accident. Blink and you'll miss it. Best fried catfish I've had. Totally not greasy. Thin cornmeal batter is the right amount of crispy. Fish is tender and moist inside without being greasy at all. Coleslaw was pretty decent. Cornbread was soft and had a hint of sweetness but not too much. Portions are good. Vegetarian options for the non-meat eater. I ate well for less than $10, tip included. Glad I found it.	3 star
	This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car. \n\nAttention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks.	4 star
	They also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which I didn't notice until driving!	2 star
	it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food.	1 star
	Good food, quick service. Kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd. Great tea!	2 star
	You know what's great? Walking into a banking establishment and having the tellers know your name! I've been with Sunwest for 27 years, and I've never had any fees charged to me (yay automatic and free overdraft protection!) Your mileage may vary, but I love these guys. This branch is fantastic. All the employees are friendly and knowledgeable.	4 star
	This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer \"footlong\" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery.	1 star
	When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!	2 star
	It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time.	0 star
	This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.	1 star
	The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore.	2 star
	On vacation and this place was across the street. The guy who helped me was very nice. He carried on conversation and reccommeded places I should try in the area while visiting. I wish I knew his name to put on here. He spoke english and lived in North Carolina at one time. Anway, prices were good and service	4 star
	I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch, but they always look delicious. Some of their regular sushi rolls are a little pricey, but other than that, no complaints. A great lunch spot!	3 star
	This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road.	2 star
	love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.	3 star
	This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty, it's just the trashy sign on the fountain drink saying not to put stuff in the drain. I also didn't like the \"real\" trash can being turned around so there's no access to the door and a large \"kitchen\" grey trash can sitting right beside it. All in all a good visit, but not a 5.	3 star
	Pretty good.  Typical sports bar food. Calimari was ok, chili was pretty good, fries were awesome, and the burger wasn't bad.\nMy friend had the bases loaded big unit (as seen on man vs food). It is an insanely huge hotdog with all the toppings. Could feed 3-4 people.\nExpect to pay $15 or so per person.	3 star
	Awesome staff, great food and cool decor	4 star
	I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat.	1 star
	This place is a lot of fun as a result of the atmosphere and pleasant wait staff!  The menu rocks a combination of vegetarian items, low carb items, and greasy guilty pleasures.\n\nThe only problem is that it may be difficult to locate parking during peak hours, especially when a sporting event is taking place.\n\nDoes anyone know how frequently Mr. Cooper makes appearances in his restaurant?  I'm just curious...	3 star

	I was in town on the night the Lakers were also in town. BF and I and a friend decided to try to get tix from a scalper. Not knowing the venue, well it figures we got jipped. We got tickets to something they call the verve lounge. Its like a club in between the lower and upper levels. OK thats fine except there is nowhere to sit and the view is lame.\nNOT worth it, I would rather sit in the nosebleeds, then again I'd rather be at Staples Center.	1 star
	Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end! \n\nThe wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team	4 star
	This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.	2 star
	Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them.	4 star
	The AZ Science center is great for kids which is why Adult's Night Out is twice as good!\n\nI checked out the science center at last nights first Friday of the month \"adults only night\".  Not only was admission free but they validated out parking making it free as well.  We were able to check out all of the exhibits with little or no wait and with adults only it was much less hectic than on a regular day.	3 star
	Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them.  Holy cow, what a disaster.  Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all.  This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits.  They really need to get this under control.	1 star
	My husband and I attended the yelp sponsored date night at the Arizona Science Center. We had a blast checking out all the hands-on exhibits as well as the planetarium. The Van Gogh Alive! was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art, music, and quotes.	4 star
	This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.	0 star
	Rosita's is alright. I wouldn't file it under authentic Mexican food, but I certainly wouldn't call it Americanized either. Their beginnings were likely with authentic ingredients and recipes, but over time, things change a bit. I would say the best thing at this restaurant isn't on the menu: chips and salsa.	3 star
	I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.	1 star

	I rear ended someone and the damage to my car was bad! My insurance didn't cover it, so I had to pay completely out of pocket. Ultra Collision fixed my car for HALF the price of all the other estimates I got. Not only did Steven work really hard to get me the best price possible, but the whole process took less than a week and the car looks amazing! I am so happy!	4 star
	Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal.	3 star
	Open 24/7, thank goodness!\n\nWhen I start work before 6 am at the hospital next door, I stop by and grab a coffee. \n\nSometimes, for those extra long days, I get a warm biscuit with honey, just to give me an added little pep, lol.  Don't judge me ;)\n\nI did try their Taquito with Sausage & Cheese. It was actually good. I asked for both the red and green salsa so I could taste test and see which I liked best. The red salsa won by a landslide.\n\nThe service at this location is always top notch. Friendly and professional.	2 star
	I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.	4 star
	I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated. \n\nI'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep.	3 star
	tried this place for the first time today, and i was impressed...\n\nthe place is a little hard to get into though, and i'm sure during a lunch rush it's crazy..\n\ntheir pasta salad is one of the best i've ever had...bowtie noodles, my fav...loaded with green onions so be careful!\n\ni got the bird is the word, which was delicious but lacking a good sauce inside...the pico de gallo was fresh and juicy as was the lettuce..and the wrap was so soft i could sleep on a bed of them...\n\nsuper cute inside.	3 star
	This place makes really, really authentic Mexican food.  It's part restaurant, bakery, and grocery.  I go here for the Burritos.  Big, soft, house made tortilla and filling! I always order green chile, chicken, deep fried.  It's sooo huge, but good!  You can do Enchilada style or plain, option to add your typical toppings like Guac, sour cream, cheese, etc.	3 star
	Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.	0 star
	La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation.	4 star
	I love hole-in-the-wall taco joints ... usually. Not so here. I got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos. Soft corn tortillas, of course. No flavor on either - I guess they really rely on their salsa bar. The carnitas bordered on inedible due to the very hard crust on the meat. Might try this again someday just to try to see how it got so many 5-star reviews, but this trip was barely worth 2.	1 star
	Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland, so I decided to add chili paste. It was hot, but tasteless. It was on the way to downtown, but will note return here again. YUCK!!!	1 star
	My third timing coming. I really want to work with them because there's not much Chinese in Phoenix and the staff is super nice; however, the sauce is horrible! More so, it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring, blabs way too sweet sauce. I will not be back.	1 star
	Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!	4 star
	I have been seen by the Nurse Practitioner Christa and Dr. Laura Kimbro so far. Both experieces have been good. They are really good about following up with you. They can do ultrasounds right in the office if your insurance covers it.  They do all their baby deliveries at Banner Desert.\n\nOne small complaint...they take the whole thanksgiving weekend off. Although there is someone always on call, it would be nice if they were open that friday.	4 star
	Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix.	4 star
	Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes.	2 star
	Expensive and just ok.	1 star
	I miss this place.  I used to work right across the street from McAlp's and would go there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is great, food is good, and deserts are tasty.  Its nice to see that some places in the Phoenix area don't feel the need to constantly renovate and are not afraid to keep their days gone by look, feel and approach to business.  Writing this is making me hungry for their food again.  I need to find an appointment to schedule downtown so I can lunch there next week.	3 star
	You can't beat the atmosphere at this place. I bought a google offer for here a while ago and stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. There were some people inside but it wasn't too crowded. I started in the antique shop wandering around and then made it into the restaurant. I had an ice-cream soda and it was divine. Next time I'd probably split one as the drinks are large. I didn't eat anything but the food looked yummy. I also wandered to the vintage shop next door. It was fun looking around and reminscing.	4 star
	I can understand how this location can get some extra points for being quaint  but it will certainly not get points for being clean.  The soda I had was great but I could not get over how dirty and run down this place was.  The staff where inattentive and to be honest completely useless, the tile on the floor was pealing off, the bar looked very warn and the booth we sat in was sticky. I understand the concept but I cannot forgive dirt when I visited a location.   I won't be back again.	1 star
	great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts.	4 star
	The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!	4 star
	Red Chile Burro, Enchilada Style. \nDONE AND DONE!\n\nShow up on Saturday or Tuesday and you MIGHT be blessed with tacos made by Nana. I've been coming here for 5 years (which makes me a newbie) and while at first I thought the burros were a bit off in the red chile/tortilla ratio, you won't forget the flavor of the red chile. One morning, you'll wake up after a night of too much fun and CRAVE Rito's.\n\nFamily owned and operated this little gem is worth the weight (and wait) in gold. Just don't forget...cash only!	3 star
	Hands down the best mariscos(seafood) EVER! I love the shrimp ceviche and when I am in the mood for a hot plate the Shrimp Culichi is the best choice, shrimp soaked in some delicious green salsa and smothered with oaxaca cheese, YUMMY! The Micheladas and the margaritas are excellent and well priced.  They have Mariachis every friday night from 7p to 9p, if you want the trip to Mexico feel, this is your place!!	4 star
	Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong.	4 star
	The service was pretty fast. I was not too impressed with food. Ordered the culichi shrimp and a consume. My rice was undercooked, there was literally 5 shrimps in the green sauce. The sauce was very watered down. My consume was pretty flavorless, I added salt and limes sadly it didn't help. It was not the best I had but not the worst. Would not come here again.	2 star
	Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.	0 star
	Dropping some stars due to the Luminaria policy. Myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago. It rained today, so the luminarias were canceled, which I understand. However, as the event is sold out every other night, we were told we could not get tickets for another night and could get a refund or donate our ticket money. I do appreciate the refund, and I know they cannot control the weather, but I do think it stinks that we will miss the luminarias through no fault of our own.	2 star
	Awesome!\n\nGrowing up in Scottsdale, I never went to the botanical gardens. I mean come on, what's there to do there? It's not the same as going to the zoo.\n\nBut now, it's a must. Go around dusk or check out their website for one of their events. The Chihuly Exhibit was pretty cool last year. And that's what I like, they're more than just a bunch of cacti. \n\nBring a camera.	4 star
	I love the garden.  I go walking here 3-4 nights a week, because I work close by.  I have a couple of spots I love to sit and commune with nature.  I can't tell you, because then I'd have to kill you.  Bunnies, frogs, lizards, quail...love to watch the wildlife.  I keep missing the king snake, who lives near the patio cafe.  I only wish people would realize it's a garden, not a playground or amusement park.  Modulate your voices, please!	3 star
	A great place, no doubt, but with admission at $18 per adult, it has the feel of an expensive tourist trap.  Why pay so much for someone to \"show you nature\"?\n\nMy suggestion: Go out and explore the desert on your own.\n\n-Hike in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve area. (One of many parks.)\n-Explore the saguaros and lush desert outside the city. (My favorite region is toward Florence Junction & Superior along US Highway 60.)\n-Visit a retail cactus farm. (There are many!)\n\nThen again, if you're a tourist and don't mind spending the money, go for it.	2 star
	Love the Chihuly Art throughout the gardens, I was bummed that the cafe was closed. It's definitely a great walk this great scenery! Lovely for photos!	3 star
	What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.	4 star
	Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \"crew\" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable.	0 star
	The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.	1 star
	Big rooms. Clean but have a smell to them. The included 7a-10a buffet breakfast is good (needs sausages,though). Nice to have that refrigerator & microwave,too. Free shuttle to the airport on the half hour was extremely convenient. Tipping at breakfast and with the shuttle (which can take or pick you up at places in less than a 2 mile radius) is appreciated just the same as you would your housekeeper.	3 star
	I really like this place. We used to come here often and then didn't for a long time just because we weren't in the hood when they were open. The las two weeks I've been by and had a late lunch. The people that t=run this place are so genuinely nice. The ensalada drink is refreshing in this heat. I usually get a veg papusa and fried plantain. My husband had the chicken soup and loved it and then the chicken special and loved it. I'm so glad we went back.	3 star
	Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well.	3 star
	Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!	0 star
	Delhi Palace has won my heart for Indian food.  There is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time.  I'm not sure if this location is associated with the Delhi Palace on University, but I have been to both and liked both.  Sometimes Indian food buffets can feel not so fresh, but both of these restaurants keep things fresh and heated.  \n\nThis restaurant has my stamp of approval as my favorite Indian food in the Phoenix area.	4 star
	Avoid the lunch buffet.  Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala.	2 star
	went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.	0 star
	Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala, well Ive had better. The buffet is above average and as always the Naan was wonderful!	1 star
	came here last Saturday night with a friend. the food is very good and you get a large portion - I had leftovers for lunch the next day. my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burnt/crispy than I like. I will be back to try their weekend buffet though.	3 star
	Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained, wanted to wear flip flops in my room. Towels scratchy. They need to raze it and start over.	0 star
	Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food, don't stop by Friday nights. The place is packed. It you like white pizza, this place is worth the stop.	3 star
	Yay! Really great venue to get up close and personal to see any acts that you may like. Everything from jazz, to comedy, to hip-hop has been absolutely wonderful here. Not the classiest selection of snacks, and not the most scenic surroundings, but who cares? You are within shouting distance of the artist, that's pretty cool.\n\nThey recently dropped the fee for the parking, so yay for free parking too! All in all, a great venue.	3 star
	This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.\n\nThe BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.\n\nOh, and they also have Alcohol!!	3 star
	Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions.	2 star
	This was a pretty decent place for good BBQ.  There isn't that much variety - mostly focused on BBQ meat sandwiches.  The good thing is that despite the small menu, what they do have is pretty good - I had the BBQ beef, which was tasty and had a ton of flavor.	2 star
	I feel bad giving them 2 stars, the first time I went I LOVED the bbq, so good, so tender.  Second time I went, same thing, BUT I got food poisoning!  A busy, well known place like that shouldn't have that happen.  I'm never eating there again.	1 star
	Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!	2 star
	I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race, Indy car race and  the races at Manzanita.  Great food, great portions and great atmosphere.	3 star
	Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!	4 star
	The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.	0 star
	This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!	4 star
	It was a nice zoo but VERY small. And I mean extremely small. I've been to free zoos that have more to offer. You could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace. Not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals. Not worth the price in my opinion.	2 star
	ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..	1 star
	My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again.	0 star
	Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem, lack of posting for the appropriate tee off locations.\nPlease mark by colors at each tee off. Provide better signage for those of us who are new to this course. Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate.	2 star
	Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip.	2 star
	These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors.\nYou guys Rock!!!	4 star
	This is a restaurant I have been to umpteen times and thought of reviewing just now. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant. Though admittedly, i havent experimented too much here, i have found what I love and stick to it. And that special list includes water boiled chicken, green beans with bacon, spinach with garlic, fish in black bean sauce. Order from the chinese menu, dont go with the cliche of kung pao chicken when all of these yummy dishes exist.	3 star
	Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!\n\nFood is great, they are fast, and friendly. \n\nI love this place!	3 star
	For the price at lunch I am not sure you can get much better.  The food is good to great.  The price is cheaper then Panda Express and it blows that out of the water.  I love the Sweet and Sour, and the Kung Pau.  They give you soup and a salad with your meal as well.	3 star
	Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.	0 star
	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)	0 star
	There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area, as a Chinese student, I would like to say the Szechwan palace can represent the authentic Chinese food.  I ordered Mopo Tofu, Chongqing Hotpot and Boiled beef and fish today. All dishes are really spicy and I really love it.	3 star
	The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread	2 star
	Cheap and low-quality\n\nA decent selection at a fair price, but the quality is far less than Sweet Tomatoes.  The salad bar wasn't kept fresh (wilted lettuce, low containers), the pizza was like a frozen type (crappy crust and sauce), greasy/oil atop of the meat for the tacos.  I won't go on.\n\nOn that note, it serves the purpose for a buffet - mass quantities for the masses.\n\nI will not go back.  I would prefer to spend $3-4 extra dollars to go to Sweet Tomatoes any day.	1 star
	Good food\nFriendly service (only if they are not busy)\nI mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour	1 star
	No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.	1 star
	Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. \n\nOne of the worst dinning experiences EVER!\nMe and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. \nIf the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. \nSad sad restaurant. \nNever again.	0 star
	Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game, which is a lot to ask in Midtown Phoenix. :)	2 star
	Stayed here when I traveled for work about a month ago. \n\nWhat I liked:\n-Really liked the room; bed, separate room for sofa, tv, and mini fridge\n-free Internet in my room\n-great rate for a weeknight, just around $100\n-hotel had a cool interior, open floors, but not loud where you could hear chatter.\n\nWhy no fifth star:\n-parking garage is really confusing to navigate\n-breakfast was a bit expensive, get the buffet, not the menu items.\n\nWould come back here since it's close to work and good value for a Hilton.	3 star
	I now know where the hipsters are in Phoenix. \nAn easy ordering menu like In-N-Out, but with fresh rustic sandwiches.  \nOnly four different sandwiches, four different salads, and a small variety of sodas in a bottle makes life easy to decide.    \nI liked the quick service, the banter between the staff and regulars, and bench seating.  \nI don't like that it's only open for lunch on the weekdays.\nWhatever they are doing though, they are doing it right, because I think about eating there a lot and their other restaurant Pizzeria Bianco.	3 star
	Always a great meal, tomato moz sandwich amazing, focia pizza amazing	4 star
	Super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients. Tasty sandwiches and salads. Fast and friendly service. Adorable country farm feel. What's not to love?	3 star
	I've never eaten here, just had a friend describe to me how he was kicked out for \"speaking spanish\".  A bit in shock that a business in America thinks this is helpful in anyway.  If it's true then I suggest nobody eat here but Separatist douchebags.	0 star
	The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.	2 star
	Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food.	3 star

	Finally, a chic and affordable Aveda salon in downtown Phoenix. Hooray! I love this place. The ladies at the front desk are SO warm and inviting - they're the kind of people who would make you forget all about your bad day. I trust Lilly with my waxes - she is friendly and very knowledgeable. I was scared for my first wax and asked her about a million questions, all of which she answered thoroughly and with patience. I haven't had a haircut here yet, but definitely plan on it.	4 star
	Great place. As one reviewer said this is NOT a meat-market. Smart trainers, great use of space and allow you to get in and get out quick with 30 minute workouts. The trainers here don't rely on machine circuits like many other gyms. At Vitality you are using dumbbells, kettlebells, TRX, barbells, medicine balls and even flipping tires or hitting the heavybag. The owner is incredibly nice, and make sure to ask for Liz if you want a trainer who is high energy and will kick your butt!	4 star
	I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location.	0 star
	I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.	1 star
	Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours.	1 star
	10/23/13\n\nAt the VA facility today for long awaited appointments. Prior to departing I had the opportunity to visit the travel office. At the travel office I picked up a number(69) from the ticket machine, they overhead counter read 29!\nIf this wasn't bad enough, two windows were open and one employee occupying the right window was actually sitting down at the service counter reading a NEWSPAPER, while literally dozens of vets were waiting patiently to be seen.  Are these the kind of employees the Phoenix VA have as support staff? God help us all.	1 star
	Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..\n\nVeterans DESERVE better than this!!	0 star
	i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy	3 star
	These type of chain places are noy my jam- It was OK- they do have some pretty awesome Happy Hour Specials on drinks and food- that being said, i would come back, but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during HH- otherwise, you are getting crap.	1 star
	Hands down, this place has the BEST sandwiches in AZ!\n\n1. Great Bread\n2. Generous size portion of meat in each sandwich.\n3. Nice variety of sandwiches.\n\nWild Turkey is my personal favorite sandwich.\nBrie/ Boar's Head Turkey/ Lettuce/ Tomato on Sourdough Bread.	4 star
	I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.	1 star
	They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.\n\nPeople must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.\n\nHere's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your \"food\" and agree with most people that this place is decent.	0 star
	The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.	3 star
	It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!	3 star
	oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um, well, it was silken tofu.  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal.  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing.	0 star
	The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!	4 star
	I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.	0 star
	Rip . off.  Thief People Up In There.	0 star
	Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central. \n\nI love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for \"Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains\" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it! \n\nI like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.\n\nIf you are a movie buff this store is for you.	4 star
	Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.	1 star
	Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. \n\nThey have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. \n\nThe only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them.	4 star
	Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.	3 star
	I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use.	3 star
	I brought in a pair of red suede Dolce Vita heels, with a rather large black scuff mark on the side of it, thinking there wasn't anything I could do to save them due to the color and material. However, Nerik proved me wrong and made them look almost brand new again. I was beyond impressed and completely satisfied with his work! I would highly recommend them for all your shoe and alteration needs! Thanks again Central Shoe Repair!	4 star
	Sonora is wonderfully average.\n\nYou will never be surprised by anything here, as when they tell you the beer won't be cold because it's casket, it won't be cold. The hot wings are hot, the fresh salads are fresh, and they always cook things to order and are always accurate (mid rare is always mid rare... a rarity!). I love brewhouses so the local brews are delish.\n\nThere's nothing surprisingly good at Sonora, but I'll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday!	4 star
	Good stuff.  Haven't had too much of the food.  Onion rings are delicious.  All beers delicious.  Good joint to grab a growler for the drive home...I mean for when you get home.	3 star
	Delicious, finely crafted beer! Good food and friendly staff.	4 star
	Average beer... Great food.	2 star
	If you're into great craft beer, don't waste your time here. The cask conditioned IPA tastes like dish water. Food was average. Meh.	1 star
	Been here before to skate and its very nice, friendly, and not crowded by any means :)	4 star
	M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.	3 star
	Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!	4 star
	As a Socially Liberal Feminist I would NEVER go here, but if I slipped up, The Hi-Liter  would be my favorite of the genre.\n\nI've heard that it's just seedy enough, but not too much, and with top notch \"talent\".  I mean ... that's what I've heard anyway.\n\n*Oink Oink*	4 star
	Not the biggest, baddest or hottest strip club in town but for a night out with my friends it was fun.  Plenty of good looking girls, not too pushy and very friendly.  Dances were decent for $10, some girls were much better at it then others.  Drinks were typically overpriced, just like any other strip club.  When there's another night out with the guys...I'll make sure to bring this place up again.	2 star
	I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley.	3 star
	The girls are beautiful!!! Bartenders & waitresses are AMAZING.. The DJ's are great... This place is FUN... The drink specials are always good... \n\nDON'T EAT THERE.... The cook is dirty... don't get me wrong the food is great... But don't eat if Chef Rudy is cooking he's dirty he does dirty nasty to the food..	3 star
	This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.	4 star
	I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had. What makes or breaks a Mexican restuarant for me is the chip and salsa and I thought the chips and salsa were average at Juans.\nI had the combo #15 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef or chicken taco w rice and beans. The refried beans were the best part, they are super tasty. The price is right and the portions are big.	2 star
	Lots of food, low price\nLarge choice, good chips, salsa warm\nTastes good anytime\n\nI was sure I'd written another review of Juan's.  The pictures on the Welcome tab still scream, \"Write! write! write!\" at me.\n\nWhy am I trying to write Haiku for a Mexican restaurant?  \n\nArizona, U.S.A.  \n\nNevermore	3 star
	This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing	3 star
	This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. \n\nUnfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!\n\nI suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted.	0 star
	Second try:\n\nSo I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!	4 star
	I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed	0 star
	Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent .	4 star
	This location has a nice patio, but it is too close to parking lot and a bunch of flies make their home out there as well. My salad was huge as usual for a small and I can't recall the name, but it had feta and cranberries I think and then I added chicken for three bucks more. You know what you are getting here and it's usually good and worth the price since leftovers are almost always available.	3 star
	gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.\n\ni dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area.	1 star
	Amazing that a cafe like this can do great sushi, Italian pasta, and ramen!  Try the low carb soy noodles in your Italian dish.  Good stuff.	4 star
	LOOOOVE this place!! PAD Thai is delicious :)	4 star
	Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon.	3 star
	Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here.	0 star
	They told me that the oil change would take an hour to an hour and a half. It ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part. In their defense they said it was possible it would take longer. That was fine but when the person at the front\ndesk starts talking politics, swearing, and pushing his beliefs, that is when the line of professionalism was crossed. The car works great but the customer service left much to be desired.	1 star
	Dr. Keith's office called our house to remind me that my appointment was the following day. My girlfriend answered and told them \"Oh don't worry, he'll be there.....he just loves to go to the dentist\".\nI love going to Dr. Keith's office. They are gentle , thorough, caring and honest. They do excellent work.  Thanks Scott for taking care of me over the years.	4 star
	We had a terrific experience here.  Tim the manager was very approachable and explained the process very clearly.  They listened to my specific needs (when I needed my car back, etc) and accommodated me.   More importantly, the job they did was fantastic-a repair to back bumper, and the work was immaculate.\n\nI would highly recommend them!	4 star
	I just moved here from Seattle and wanted to have a hotdog.  I saw this place one night when it was close and we decided to go back the next day when they opened.\n\nThe menu was intimadating at first, so I had to ask the girl what was what.  I ordered the quarter pound.  Yummy!  BF ordered the Reuben, which looked really good with the cheese sauce on it.\n\nWe will be back	4 star
	Nothing special, to be honest.  I am a huge supporter of small business owners. Sadly, Sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns. Also his lemonade offered with special (says machine is broken, awaiting repair) is disgusting, watered down. Sadly, after all these years driving by... I know why I have not ever stopped in....and never will again.  :/	1 star
	Literally the best. \n\nAlways have free samples and are willing to skewer just about everything they own on a toothpick for you to try.\n\nThis is a good first step if you dream of having a good relationship with a butcher like all those TV chefs do.	4 star
	I really dig the rhythm room! I went to a concert here on Monday night. \n\nit was cute.\nit was quaint.\nit was CLEAN.\ngreat bartenders, love the option to sit or to stand. \n\nthe sound guy was a bit off and im pretty sure my ear is still ringing from the high pitched squeel when the microphones got too close to the speaker or something. but hey, it happens i guess. \n\ni had a blast at this sweet little spot.	3 star
	The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.	1 star
	LOVE going to the eye doctor now!  They can get me in and out in no time.  Extremely friendly staff!	4 star
	Staff is knowledgable and friendly. They have a big space, and hold lots of comic related event, but also gaming events for RPG's and CCG's. I visited all the comic shops when I moved here from NYC looking for a new on to feed my comic addiction, and Samurai is the one that I choose as the most real.	4 star

	Oops...-\nI forgot to add to my review about Jayme my stylist...that out of all the cities I've lived in & stylists I've visited...Jayme is by far my favorite & the most personable & talented stylist in town! Make an appointment today...you won't be disappointed!!!:)	4 star
	Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro. I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.  I love that she knows how I like my hair cut and make sure that I don't chop it all off. Mara offers fantastic hair cuts for a great price! She offers hair coloring services and she does amazing work. She's the best secret in Phoenix!	3 star

	I was informed by Volvo I Am that I needed a new AC compressor at a cost of $1300. I had a second opinion at the Volvo dealership who told me that my AC unit was just fine. In addition to the unethical business practices of this shop, the owner was extremely rude and aggressive.	0 star
	Went back to Volvo Am I for a maintenance check, and the second visit was as positive as the first.  Volvo Am I Fane	3 star
	I went to this shop based on the high ratings. \n12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things.	0 star
	Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\n\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\n\nI would go back, but with low expectations.	2 star
	Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Arlin B, Robyn N & Mike C.  Scott's was a bit of a disappointment for me this time.  My expensive bowl of Kreplach Soup was lukewarm & only contained one little Kreplach the size of a Ping Pong ball!  Even the smaller cup sized soup should have two or three of them.  My corned beef sandwich was good but the service was only so-so.  Considering all of this and the prices, it's down to 3 Stars this time for Scott's.\n\nCorned Beef Sandwich $10.95, bowl of Kreplach Soup $7.95 (!)	2 star
	Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately, there was no rift caused in our friendship.	1 star
	Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!	3 star
	Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.	4 star
	This place is as bad to be expected! \n\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \n\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!	2 star

	Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick \nEPIC FAIL!!!!!!	1 star
	I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait.	4 star
	Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue. Took a taxi over a month ago because I assumed they would be showing the ufc fights. No such luck, sports bar anyone?\nWas a fun night anyway with beer, darts and conversation. Would definately go back.	3 star
	I can almost always find something fan-fuckin-tastic for less than half the price it'd be in it's original store.	3 star
	It's pricey, but you're investing in quality products and garments. I've been here twice while in Phoenix, and have ordered some products online. They carry great names, and have some solid styles. Most importantly, the guys working there are sincere and patient. You're never pressured to purchase, but you're likely to walk out with something.	4 star

	THANK YOU TOY BOX!!\nI took my car to the Toy Box to have them take a second look at $800 worth of work - strut replacement - that another valley mechanic had quoted me.

Thanks again Phill and crew...you guys are the best!!	4 star

	Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good.	1 star
	The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.	2 star
	Why hadn't I thought of Smart & Final before when we've hosted parties?\n\nThey sell in quantities large enough to handle a good sized crowd without going overboard.\n\nThe layout is simple and clean. It was organized the day I went in, and the staff are quite pleasant. I'll have to keep this place in mind for our next party and Thanksgiving, and New Years. And Valentine's Day. Oh, and don't forget about Earth Day!	3 star
	3.5. It was very quiet when we went, no dancers or band. The food and service were great- the one exception being the salad. It had too much dressing. The feta was delish- very subtle. \nI had the moussaka- it was very tasty! Decent portions size, along with potatoes and vegetables. They are not stingy with the bread either, which is a rarity. My companion had the chicken with lemon and artichoke, it was good, but I preferred my moussaka.\nWould I go back? Absolutely. But next time, Id like to see the dancers!	3 star
	Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)	4 star
	My usual stylist Marina and my backup Suzie weren't there when I came in so I took a chance on Diem-Thuy (aka Christina). I didn't have to worry, she did a GREAT job! She knew exactly how to cut my hair and she was so nice and professional. So, if Marina is your usual stylist and she isn't there don't be afraid to try Christina!	4 star
	It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.	3 star
	We had a problem with the way a poster was mounted for framing at another Michael's location and took it to the nearest location to us on East Camelback. We spoke with Shane , the manager of the framing section. He was very polite and helpful. He had us leave the framed print for remounting and personally handled the work the next day at no charge. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the work and the way in which we were treated.	4 star
	I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing.	1 star
	THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!	4 star
	Maybe I should have got the chicken fried steak.  Because that steak I had was something else.  There was so much grease piled on top of my t-bone that I'm pretty sure I'm a likely candidate for the world's youngest triple bypass patient.  I'll admit, sometimes grease makes for good grubbin'.  But not this time.\n\nI went on a Saturday night and there was a little bit of a wait. But our server was plenty kind.  She completely forgot our order of fried okra, but I wasn't feeling too upset about it.	1 star
	Best chicken fried steak bar none in Phoenix.  I come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too.  The atmosphere is VERY casual and VERY country.  I cant stand country music but its worth it for this place.  It is also a pretty inexpensive place for a good steak if you are looking.  Service is always good, parking is what really sucks here but if you go when there is not a big rush you will be okay.	4 star
	The filet here is awesome at only $22 (with fries, a salad, and biscuits and bread). Additionally, there is great Texas stuff all over the walls, with a definite focus on the Big Bend (Marfa, Terlingua, etc.) and Gulf Coast regions. Good weeknight specials, but I have not tried weekend brunch yet. I've been here about 3 times. It's a real chicken fried steak kind of place, so don't bring a woman here unless she's into that kind of thing.	3 star
	I'm not a huge bar person, so walking into a dive bar on this side of town was scary.  Was I not with a big strong male, I would have likely not even bothered.  I got a wineburger, onion rings, and beer.  The service was incredibly friendly and the conversation at the bar was entertaining.  The burger was incredibly flavorful although sort of greasy and the beer and onion rings were average. I would totally go back here (with company) for burgers and the creepy yet surprisingly friendly and entertaining atmosphere.	3 star
	I'm a thrift store junkie and this particular Goodwill location is just junkie. I've never really been impressed with the finds at this location and it has that stale grandma's dead cat smell when you walk in. That being said, they seem to have an OK selection of older furniture if you're looking for something to fix up or paint. \n\nYou should really go to the one on 20th St. & Indian School if you're in this area. They just built that one about a year and a half ago and it's clean and has great stuff.	1 star
	Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl \"Lucille\". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen.	0 star
	This place is decent. The prices are alright and the menu has a lot more than just sushi. The service has kind of depended on the time of day I have gone. The lunch service has always been pretty good, the dinner service was pretty slow. We waited 30-40 mins for our sushi order. They were pretty busy, but not THAT busy. It is a pretty small place so it can definitely be a little crowded, but it's a cute little place with good sushi.	2 star
	We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning.	3 star
	We usually go here for their Sunday happy hour. The sushi is good and I've had their bbq pork noodles which have a lot of flavor, but for the most part it's not very authentic. Something different was their sushi ice cream, that was pretty awesome, you cant really go wrong with rice crispy treats and ice cream! The service has been very hit or miss.	2 star
	Ok, I'm updating my review. I come here far too often not to bump it up another notch. Plus, now I don't have to worry about someone calling me out when I stop by for my favorite chicken salad. Honestly, this is probably the best bang for your buck HH around. Who doesn't appreciate cheap and delicious food? Obviously, past Morgan didn't.	3 star
	love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular.	4 star
	This Starbucks is a bigger place than the ones I normally go to.  And everyone there has a laptop, ipad, or holding something electronic.  I felt the need to take out my cell phone and hold it.  he he he...  Everyone (customers and employees) are friendly.  They got the order spot on.  \n\nWhen we were leaving there was a GOOD dog sitting by the door with his leash not tied to anything just waiting for his owner.  Awwwwww....	3 star
	I have been to a lot of Starbucks and I thought this Starbucks was really clean and it was pretty big inside too.  This year I got a free drink for my birthday.  I was pretty excited about it, because Starbucks is one of my favorite places to go for coffee.  So, when I went up to order my Chocolate Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.  The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup.	4 star
	I didn't get ANY service at the Indian Bend store. And I do have to complain that in the past the totally fake \"Welcome to Ulta!\" got on my nerves. Wasn't comfortable in Tempe Marketplace store either. Made a trip to the Camelback store. Only waited a minute for ROCHELLE to help me. Awesome! Personable, professional, enthusiastic, knew her stuff! Bought everything she recommended. WOW. What a difference she made. Worth the drive anytime.	3 star
	Wow...I can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets!!! I am FAR from impressed...Hot giardenara? Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich?! NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude's...\nThis place is sub-par at best! If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona, go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintock...This place doesn't live up to the hype!  Don't waste your time! People who love it must not be from Chicago...	0 star

	Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive).	2 star

	It had been years since I had been to PCG; but my friends Rich & Corey said lets go there.  Decided to try brunch today.  I had the   Stacked Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas thought it might be like chilaquiles - but it was very delicious!!!  The price is very reasonable.  My friends both had Smoked Salmon Benedicts - they looked very yummy.  Also, really crave crab cakes; but haven't found a place to that serves them well. Might have to try them the next time.  A very good Sunday, will definately be back!!!	3 star
	What a pleasant surprise.  I selected PCG for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal, atmosphere and service. I tried the plank salmon which was wonderful.  Two of us had meals that included the mashed potatoes with horseradish and agreed the flavor was excellent.  I admit that as I approached the strip center on 16th street I wondered if I had made a mistake, only to be rewarded by my guests with compliments for the choice. I will return.	3 star
	I have always enjoyed dinner with friends at Phoenix City Grille. I had never tried Happy Hour there so a friend and I decided to give it a try. We sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we'd like a drink. The Green Chile Queso Fundido was quite tasty. We intended to order a few other items but We had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue Happy Hour elsewhere. Keep you posted on our return to PCG...	1 star

	This was the first groomer we tried out in the Phoenix area. They had good reviews on yelp and good prices so we gave them a try. I was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in CA. I asked for my dog's tail to get special attention. She was given back to me with matts still in her tail and her face hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Pretty disappointed will not be returning.	1 star
	Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up, with everything you need and/or can think of.  (try the grilled veggies, flank steak ...everything.!!)	4 star
	Regi B. \n\nRegi  you placed a review on yelp stating bad customer service and you never had any business dealings with us. You had a car accident with one of our contractors and YOU did not have insurance, This is your 3rd accident without insurance and you still manage to maintain a legal drivers license( amazing). You then decide to take legal action against the person you hit. You are one of the reasons that the legal system is filled with frivolous lawsuits. Just another example of someone looking for something for nothing.	4 star
	This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.	3 star
	Have always enjoyed going here. Been going here for a few years.\n\nWent for a haircut today. Same great service. \n\nThey get you in and out in a hurry but I've never had a bad haircut here.\n\nLove the hot towel and shave of the nape of your neck at the end.\n\nIf you really want to pamper yourself sometime let them give you a straight razor shave. I've gotten them a few times and each time I've almost fallen asleep. Very relaxing.\n\nAnd like previous reviewers have noticed they are foreign but I've never had any problems getting across what I want.\n\nHighly recommended.	4 star
	This might surprise you, but this place doesn't have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!\n\nSometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).\n\nWhen I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto.	3 star
	Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares.	4 star
	15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\n\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.	1 star
	Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.\n\nAlthough my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.  \n\nOverall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it.	1 star
	I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \n\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear.	2 star
	Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days, the food is better than others.  Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision. \n\nSee ya there!	3 star
	Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!	0 star
	Did not get too far into the BS. Was on hold for more than 45 mins to make an appointment. Just want to remind you all that this is a \"For-Profit\" organization. Treat them like you would any business that serves you. They do NOT have any special product or service that warrants such crappy service.	0 star
	Love the family atmosphere, very welcoming & friendly, excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry!	4 star
	My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.	4 star
	I frequented this establishment years ago, however the quality began to lapse so I moved on. I picked up a groupon a few weeks ago to give them another try.  Well even at the discount it was not worth it.  The service is still lackluster, the quality of the work leaves much to be desired.  I won't be coming back anytime soon.	0 star
	I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job.	0 star
	If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.	0 star
	People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating	0 star
	Definitely a cool spot, with a great downstairs bar. The decor upstairs is unique too. Serving Richardson's menu in the meantime, but something is missing when compared to Richardson's. I can't put my finger on it, but I don't get the same feeling. Worth visiting for sure.	2 star
	I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves	3 star
	Wow!  This place is good.  My first time in Phoenix and if I ever get back I'll be sure to dine here.  So should you.  Prego.  (You're welcome.)	3 star
	My go to place has been slipping a little.  The last couple of times I've come the food is either over cooked or under cooked.  The brie & tenderloin toast was over cooked the last 2 times to where the toast was burnt and still served and the bacon on the bacon wrapped shrimp was on the raw side. \n\nThe service is still very good and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.  They also have the best reverse happy hour which starts at 10 PM and I believe and goes til 1 AM.	2 star
	M'fn delicious !!! Amazing bartenders and servers... Great environment and the food is beyond delicious!!!	4 star
	Please tell your servers to be more responsive to their customers.  Don't sell so hard -pushy waiter that interrupts conversations. Offer a cocktail once, not 3 times,  and bring water. Don't visit the table 15 times during one meal, it is rude. Be a professional!. Our party was interrupted continuously by the chatty waiter. Not offered a wine list or bread, nor dessert or coffee. Although the cuisine was mostly delicious, he ruined it for everybody. Will not go back.	1 star
	Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies, which is your choice of 5 toppings.  Italian sausage, black olives, onions, garlic and basil.  It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either.  \n\nThe server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience.	1 star
	This is a nice little pizza place, one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil. The cheese on the knots didn't really stick well, but it was all pretty good as well.	3 star
	Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.	1 star
	I think this is the only Big Lots I've been to in PHX -- and I've only been here twice. It's fairly ghetto, and right next to a sketchy Goodwill. \n\nI didn't see it being dirty per se, but I did find it having a bunch of \"lower quality\" items -- especially in their electronics area, which is to be expected. \n\nThey did have some outdoor patio furniture, that seemed reasonably priced. I never thought of Big Lots for patio furniture..., but still wouldn't buy that here.	1 star
	Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!	4 star
	First impression: Not great. We had menu shock when we saw the dinner prices. Dinner for 2 here, will run you around $50 or more. For prices in that range with this atmosphere, it's appalling that they serve drinks in plastic party cups, and soda comes in a can.... No refills. Seriously. The food... Meh. I've had better for half the price... Actually a third of the price. Just because they were featured on food network, doesn't mean it's worth going to. In fact... Restaurants PAY THOUSANDS to shows like DD&D just to be featured.	1 star
	I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!	3 star
	This place rocks.  Super friendly.  Not just fake friendly; really.  I am sitting here in the lobby working and one of the hotel staff came up and offered me cookies.   The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines.   Even our kitty cat likes it.  Being out of your house because it is flooded and needs repair is no fun, but this places has made life much better.	4 star
	I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by these gyros. Savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch.	3 star
	I love me some Merc Bar, it's tres chic from it's comfy couches to it's awesome staff.  The drinks are indeed pricey but they pack a punch so it really all evens out in the end. How can you not love a bar that's got a twin in NYC and lets you dance on the tables?!	4 star
	I haven't been here in over a year since I lived in the biltmore.\n\nI loved this place.  Great looking women and not as pretentious as scottsdale, pretty low key yet classy. Ran into Amare one night too.\n7$ for a large glass of stolli vanil on the rocks. cant complain about that.	3 star
	Trendy, dark, crowded.\nWhen I think of Merc Bar, I think \"ehhh\"\n\nIt's not bad, just not great enough for me to remember it or frequent it on a regular basis.  \n\nThe drinks are spendy, but tasty.\nThe sausage and cheese plate is good, but not memorable.\n\nEhh.	2 star
	I like Merc for the dark, sexy, loungy atmosphere. I think its perfect for small groups to share a cheese platter and a bottle of Champagne. And when the music is hot....its hot! \n\nDisclaimer if you've never been: it's situated across the corridor from Houstons (Camelback)  and I think the sign above the door merely says \"Bar\" or \"Lounge\". \n\nEnjoy!	3 star
	This place is hidden, and hard to find for someone whose not familiar with the area.  Great people, great martinis and great customers.  My favorite bar in town.  The people who work there have been around for a while.  They know you by your name and they feel comfortable to shake your hand or give you a hag......  Sofia Lauren Martini and some oldies are one of my favorite drinks at Merc.  They have another one in NY which i have been there but i prefer the one in Phx.	4 star
	I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back.	1 star
	Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time, over-priced pizza and drinks, and so-so service.\n\nThe pizza I had with wheat crust that included eggplant, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese was pretty tasty.  I guess if you consider that I had a second meal out of the pizza, the price wasn't too bad.	2 star
	Keep trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list, though today they sent me 7 SPAM emails.  \n\nStop it! \n\nThey also have a link to review their spa's on Yelp on the e-mail - though it just goes to the Yelp homepage. \n\nThey obviously don't care much about their customers.  \n\nIt was so long ago I was there I can't remember the service.	0 star
	This is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. It is probably five stars during the slowest hours. I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends.  The laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited. They do have change machines that work well.	2 star
	Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal.	3 star
	When I went in with my daughter we ordered vegetarian sandwiches and they were pretty awful.  I know they have great deli meats and such.  I complained, and they not only sent a gift card, they actually solved the problem!  I love that.  Now they have some decent vegetarian items.   When I just get a gift certificate from some corporate PR flak,  I don't even want it sometimes because they don't even address the issue.    Miracle Mile did though.  Thank you!  You get five stars.	4 star
	Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!\n\nMy friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good. \n\nEverything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile. \n\nHepatitis schmepitiis...	4 star
	not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.	2 star
	The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!	1 star
	FYI. Chili's still sucks.	0 star
	Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here, but for now I'll be taking a break from here !!	0 star
	Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked	0 star
	I decided to try this place when the nail salon that I usually go to was full and I'm so glad I did .Susie the owner greeted me right away she's very professional and hilarious  the salon is very cleanand not super Busy I definitely will come back here next time that I need a pedicure  thank you Susie :)	4 star
	Overpriced and dirty.  Had lunch here with my wife and service was ok but salad they served was stale and moldy.  Ordered a raisin croissant, looked and tasted like it was about 4 days old which surprised us they would serve and charge for that.  Probably won't go back since there are better options in the area, scratch, chez vous, ect.	0 star
	Stopped in for some emergency supplies. (Emergency as in there was only butter in my fridge and I had one roll of toilet paper.) The employees were lovely as always, colorful, fresh fruit and vegetables greeted me and I scored in the free coffee & food that was available to sample. Trader Joe's never fails to delight and, of course, I purchased more beer and wine that is humanly necessary. Trader Joe's doesn't need a review. Of course a visit here is wonderful. This is a definite favorite of mine!	3 star
	Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.	4 star
	I have always had a great meal here.	3 star
	The room was comfortable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. However for the price the food was just ok. It was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy. Holly tooth decay Batman!	2 star
	I really can't comment on the \"value\" because my company picked up the tab, but I can say that the service they gave us was great and the food was good. I had their 16 oz steak and their cheesecake/sweet potato crust (both delicious!). Would be open to come back again.	3 star
	People seem to really like Sam's, though I am not quite sure why.  I think it is average.  Not great, not bad, just middle of the road food with a Southwestern twist.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes good, but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat.	1 star
	I had a massage here and LOVED IT!  Caite gave me one of the best massages of my life!  I can't wait to go back and see here again!\n\nThe reason I gave this place 4/5 is for the decor/set up.  They advertise themselves as a spa but the decor makes you feel like you are in a Fantastic Sam's or  Super Cut (things for sale up front, mostly hair stations, very small bathroom, very small rooms for spa services.  \n\nI do plan on returning but only to get massages!	3 star
	I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.	2 star
	Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....	3 star
	This is a restaurant I go to because I am hungry, want good, healthy food, pleasant service and I try something new almost every time. May, the nice young lady who always has a smile and great suggestion is a 5 Star server. It's also a good idea to order some fried chicken to go once you finish your meal.	4 star
	This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it.	4 star
	I've been to Baby Kay's a couple of times and have sampled the catfish, gumbo and red beans and rice. The catfish basket and gumbo were so so while the red beans and rice took the gold. I think Baby Kay's needs some work on their lunch menu. I personally think that $50 for lunch for three people that didn't order any alcohol is a pretty steep price to pay for medicore food. I'm not too excited to make a third trip to Baby Kay's.	1 star
	Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  \nAbove average food, better service, higher than expected prices.	2 star
	My boyfriend and I are both from Louisiana so we were excited to try Baby Kay's. We both had the Bloody Mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. He got the shrimp po-boy and I got the veggie \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Both were quite good. On our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. Next time we'll stick with the poboy! No vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad.	3 star
	I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back.	1 star
	The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.	4 star
	I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.	1 star
	You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!	3 star
	I've stayed here twice before, and I think it's a wonderful place for anyone's who's visiting.  Close the mall, movie theatre, Biltmore, and most importantly, Shreiner's Sausages.  Really, though.  It's always clean, roomy, good A/C.  Probably one of the best Embassy Suites I've visited.  And way cheaper than the Biltmore, for sure.	3 star
	The food was pretty disappointing for the price, and the drinks menu left much to be desired.  The music was ok, and the service was very close to on-point for the size of the party.  The space is tremendous; as many have said, it's one of the very few places like it in Phoenix with real history.  I just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the location.	2 star
	Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.	2 star
	I've had every carrier you can think of (except, of course, Cricket).  The customer service at T-Mobile is awesome!  I *had* to have the RAZR two years ago.  Ugh.  It was the worst phone ever.  Wasn't T-Mobile's fault, just Motorola.  Anyway, visited the store twice and had to get replacement phones.  Each time, they exchanged the phone for free.\nEven now when I have troubles, I go in and everyone is friendly and helpful.  \nI'm still with them for another couple years (I keep needing new phones!) and wouldn't change providers for anything right now.	4 star
	Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  \n\nI remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  \n\nI do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars.	2 star
	The store is small and uncomfortable, but the products are decent.	1 star
	Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist, when you move elsewhere you just have to go back... you know what I mean. I'll be 45, unemployed, living in Philly and still flying to PHX to have these guys clean my clothes.	4 star
	Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.	3 star
	I was in town -- will be moving there soon -- and looking for some good Chinese food. I haven't had any in years. Anyway, I spotted China Village and decided to give it a try, and am so happy I did. Hot tea is brought without having to ask for it (just like they all used to do!), and the food was great. Plus, the people were absolutely delightful! Wonderful service and so friendly. \n\nI can't wait to go back!	4 star
	Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.	4 star
	I got the most delicious carrot cake from Barb's the other day for my friends birthday. It was such a hit! The best carrot cake I have ever had. I was not surprised though. Everything I have ever had there was yummy. They have the greatest cheese danishes, red velvet cup cakes and cookies! \n\nThey also took the extra time to write a message on the cake for me before I left.	4 star
	Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.\n\ndo not go there.	0 star
	This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person, and you can get much better from traditional Mexican diners at half the price. Service was not good, and the food was not good. I had Fajitas, and Applebee's produces a better product. Will not go back again, and in an area dominated by a lot of quality Mexican cuisine, this is a place to skip	1 star
	this is the best car wash that I have used in Phoenix.  yelp coupon doesn't hurt either.	3 star
	The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return.	1 star
	When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. \n\nAnywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! \n\nBon Appetite!	4 star
	As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table, timely service, and a full glass of wine. Boo.	1 star
	My absolutely FAVORITE place EVER!! Seriously I've been going to Houston's concept restaurants since I was a teenager and this along with all the others never disappoints. The Hawaiian Ribeye is melt in your mouth delicious and I dream about it... seriously! Service is always amazing (especially Tom at the bar) and I am full and happy every single time I leave! If it was just a tad bit less expensive I would be there weekly but unfortunately it is a once every couple months type of place for me. That's ok though it gives me time to miss it!	4 star
	Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. \nWe sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. \nThere are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great.	0 star
	The people working at this store are awesome- they remembered me the both times I went in.  I will drive to this Autozone over the others because they are so friendly.  There was a line both times, but with the summer heat in AZ, a lot of people needed new batteries.  Bottom line- great Autozone!	3 star
	Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense.	4 star
	This is a great spot for a date, and the price is right!  Unique dishes and atmosphere.  Great specials and free desert.  I also can't say enough about the service.  Our server gave great recommendations and brought out 3 different deserts at the end of the meal.  To be honest, I had to think twice about posting a review of this place for fear that it's going to become too popular.  But I would give them 6 stars if I could.	4 star
	Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent\n\nCon:  haven't found one yet....\n\nSleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.  \nWell worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch.	3 star
	Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years.	4 star
	This is my first time to this 24..I just moved here from Cali, and I am use to half of the equipment being broken. So far so good. It is clean compared to what I am use to, and doesn't have a strange odor. It definitely does the job for what I need. Though its a little far for my taste, it will now be my home gym.	2 star
	As an 8-year vet here its obviously a good enough spot to stay a member, but unfortunately the facility ins constantly deteriorating at a faster rate than its being fixed.  With the constant new members, you would think the sign-up fees could help pay for some remodeling!	2 star
	I've been a loyal Home Depot customer for years, and this is by far the worst one I've been to in the country. I just bought a home in the area and have been to this particular location dozens of times over the last 10 months. The staff is in not knowledgable, helpful, or responsive. It's extremely disappointing, to say the least.	0 star
	The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!	0 star
	This place is a vegetarian mecca and a lot of the soy meat is gluten free which is a huge perk for people like me. The atmosphere could use some work but the food is good and it is priced well. They have fresh juices and a very healthy vibe. The service is always good and it is never super packed. If you have veggie friends that haven't discovered this place it is a gem.	3 star
	I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!	3 star
	DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, \"Peaceful Pink\" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)	4 star
	As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste.	1 star
	Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!\n\nMe today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized \"Asian\" food around.\n\nI challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state.	1 star
	I love this place. The merchandise is constantly changing and they have the best bedding (and prices) in town. And the reading glasses - cutest ever. Cookware - check. Towels - check. Cutlery - check. Really, this should be your first stop if you need something. And if you're just out shopping - good luck leaving empty handed. \n\nI need to go buy a purse today and there's one I've had my eye on... :) I'm guessing it'll be coming home today.	4 star
	Took my commuter in for an oil change and was very pleased with the cost and speed that it got done.  The location is perfect as well to just take a walk over to Costco to shop or snack while waiting.  \n\nFYI Check for coupons on their Yelp page before going it might save you some money like it did me :)	2 star
	Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.\n\nEach regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc.	4 star
	The \"street tacos\" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now, believe me later.  Strong.	3 star
	I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.\nI am just in love with it.\n\nEverytime I go to the US, I have to go there.\nCheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).\nThe meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!\n\nAlways clean and fresh with friendly staff.\n\nHealthy fast food .....\n\nJust wish that we had it in Canada !!	4 star
	This place is always busy, and mistakes are made with otherwise simple menu items.	2 star
	The hostess/lady who took my order was very polite and created brief and pleasant small talk. I ordered 2 cheese slices to go and my food was given to me within 5 minutes. The price was reasonable. The pizza was in my opinion slightly above average. The restaurant itself wasn't the most charming and the location wasn't the greatest but not the worst either. But for quick take out it was ok. Giving it 3 stars.	2 star
	I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.	2 star
	Went there today to get help with ordering unique, cute invites for my sister's baby shower!!  They had the cutest stuff!!!!  And Lydia, the owner was very helpful in making my \"vision\" a reality.  Great custom stuff!!!  Can't wait til my invites come in!!	3 star
	I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.	0 star
	I had the best experience with breakfast. \n\nThe ambiance- excellent- the reason I am coming back and can have a 5 hour dinner. \nThe service- pretty good\nThe food- from \"ok\" to \"really good\"  (but not the best)\nI recently had an over saltet paella. \n\nGreat for happy hour, not sure about the quality.. if you want something light - there are not many options. Not good if you are on gluten free, grain free diet.\nDinner/ full menu  has more options for something light. \n\nSecluded and luxurious - a great hideaway from a crazy, busy world  :)	3 star
	I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better.	2 star
	I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.	0 star
	Unless you get Holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. She seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. \n\nI recently got my haircut there from someone other than Holly and was absolutely butchered, easily the worst haircut of my life. Not only did the \"stylist\" not listen to what I wanted but she was borderline argumentative. \n\nIn short, if you walk into this location looking to get a haircut and Holly isn't there, just turn around and walk out.	0 star
	I had an absolutely stellar experience at All Smiles.  \n\nI finally got dental insurance, and made an appointment based on Alicia's review.  It helps that it's right down the street from my house too!\n\nEveryone was just great.  The hygienist was sweet and chatty, and let's just say the dentist isn't too hard on the eyes, ladies....  He has some beautiful blue eyes!\n\nI am just so pleased with the cleaning and service I received.  I will recommend All Smiles Dental to anybody!	4 star
	This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.	0 star
	Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.	1 star
	I've been here a couple times... very dive-y.  There is a very specific crowd of regulars here that know everybody. \n\nThe girls are ok. (sorry ladies)  There is a wide variety of types of ladies there... tall, skinny, wider, dark, light, almost naked, almost fully clothed... \n\nWe walked in once at about 1am... only an hour left before they closed.  They wanted to charge us the full cover. Eff that!!  So our buddy showed up who's a regular and we got in for free. haha  Good to be with the \"in\" crowd here.	2 star
	One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit, a delicious dessert, or something fun from the the store!	4 star
	Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive.	3 star
	I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day, Christmas and \"just because\" cards and notes.	3 star
	Yum!\nCute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast.	3 star
	We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts, delicious homemade English muffins (can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich w/ avocado and bacon). They sell a great bottle of inexpensive wine- Klee. And always revolving retail area w/ unique gifts. Great place to eat, shop & relax.	3 star
	Wow this place is awesome and very cool vibe\nI had the commuter sandwich with avocado to die for \nMy wife loved her ham and kale quiche \nKids can't get enough of the fruit parfait \nWish I could have breakfast here everyday\nHas a line but moves very quickly	4 star
	Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all.	0 star
	Overly priced :/ they do not clean under nails. Very nice workers though. Great customer service. ;)	2 star
	Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \"happy hour\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!	4 star
	I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!	4 star
	I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.\n\nWonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.\n\nMake reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. \n\nBest deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm	4 star
	Came here with some girlfriends for an afternoon bite/happy hour. I'm from Minnesota. Happy hour seven days a week is unheard of. What a deal. Especially with $5 glasses of wine! Any single one on the menu. \n\nThe bruschetta is amazing--recommend the apples and goat cheese. De-lish!\n\nService could be toned down somewhat; very helpful but maybe a little TOO helpful.	4 star
	Really great atmosphere, wines, etc... but I didn't think the food was very good, so I give it only 3 stars.  The bread is very thick and maybe uncooked, no oil.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping for crunchy bread with creatively delicious toppings.  The toppings are great combinations, just not executed like I expected.  I thought the bruschetta would be warm, but instead it was cold, nothing melded, and the bread was very large.  Great concept, but I don't get all the great reviews.	2 star
	This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere, a true staple.	3 star
	went here to celebrate an interview my wife went to.\n\nHad wine. Thats about it. Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer). \n\nThey try and keep their atmospheres similar between the one on central and here.\n\nThis one feels more condesnsed than the one on central. Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.\n\nFood is the same at both places.	2 star
	Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.	0 star
	I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.	4 star
	I'm conflicted on this location. On one hand, they are very close to home for me. The store is relatively clean. The service is ok. My main concern is the very limited selection of organic food. I would rather buy my organic food here, but often have to get it at the much more expensive Whole Foods. Pity	2 star
	Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. \nCan't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. \nCheers & good luck	1 star
	I am so thankful for yelp or I never would have found this place :) We went on a Sunday Morning/afternoon and were seated fairly quickly the menu is huge and it all looked great I was very pleased I ordered the french toast yum! My honey got the omlette it was good the hash browns are a little more well done than would have liked but still tasty. The staff was friendly and attentive Iwill definaty be back for more :)	3 star
	In short, the Dilly is a drinker's bar.  Cheap drinks, tons of regulars, and dark enough to make it easy to forget the world outside.  Hipsters beware, this isn't the Little Woody, it isn't the Vig...hell, it's not even Hazelwood's, but it is a great place to unwind.\n\n- pool table, check\n- darts, check\n- TVs, check\n- jukebox, check\n- strange edibles served out of a liquid-filled jar, check\n- seasoned, female bartender that doesn't take shit from anyone, check\n- fellow customer offering to give you a tattoo right there, for free, check	3 star
	A trifecta of goodness - service, food, and value.  I stopped in to pick up lunch for a working Saturday at the office.  The value family meals are just that.  Plenty of everything and very flavorful.  Also, it is very clean inside the restaurant and the salsa bar was well stocked and tidy as well.	3 star
	This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back, he refused. Then I asked the guys in the garage to give them to me and the GM told me \"to stop being crazy!\" Excuse me!?! No. Never coming back here again!!! They will screw up everything!!	0 star
	My buddy took me to this place, I had some sliders and a couple hot dogs, The sliders are very simular to white castle's and I wasn't very impressed with the dogs but it was fairly cheap and you got a lot of food. Fun little location. I did buy a shirt haha.	2 star
	1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.	4 star
	The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!	0 star
	Where has this place been all my life?\n\nBest burger on this side of town. I'd recommend the full-size burgers over the sliders, which, while still delicious, somewhat pale in comparison.\n\nGenerous portions for a very reasonable price.\n\nWhen I worked close by, I'd try to eat here once a week for a daily special that I liked.	4 star
	They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount.	3 star
	Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.	4 star
	Absolutely the best red curry in history.  Wife loved the brocoly chicken.  I live in Idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in Phoenix I go out of my way for.  Thai lahna is one of them..	4 star
	Stopped in here on a whim as I was passing by and hungry, plus I love Thai food.\n\nService was prompted and they seem to have quite a few regular customers. I have a yellow curry dish with was flavorful and had just enough spice prepared medium that I have a nice sweat going. They lunch special was very reasonable and filling.\n\nI would stop by again if I'm in the area and have a Thai craving.	2 star
	Perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the Monday morning absolutely useless. My wife and I took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when I hadn't heard from them by 11.40 I decided to call. The response was we are running behind schedule because Monday's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted. I would not recommend this company.	0 star
	The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!	0 star
	I do not recommend.	0 star
	Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here.	4 star
	Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.	1 star
	Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.	1 star
	I've tried and tried to find something I like at these restaurants and I just can't come up with a reason to go back. \n\nI tried the Lo Mein with chicken. It smelled good but, what I got was 3 lbs of noodles in an overly sweet sauce with a few julienne carrots and few sprouts. The chicken was dry and chewy. I just don't get the draw.	1 star
	Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart.	2 star
	Great service, great selection! My husband and I both got bikes here, we could've got them somewhere else, but the people here were so nice, that we came back and had them order the bikes for us. Plus they gave us a discount since we bought two bikes. They built my bike in just a couple hours for me, and I LOVE IT! So glad we found this place on yelp!	4 star
	Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free, so sweet.	4 star
	Pros: Consistent quality. I like the pepperoni pizzone and my sister likes the Hershey chocolate sticks. \n\nCons: Why would I bother to place my order online hours in advance, if its not going to be ready when I arrive? They didn't even start making it till I got here. Additionally, they got my order wrong! Scary neighborhood and parking lot full. I had to park in the shopping complex next to this one.	0 star
	Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.	3 star
	The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous, kind of didn't sizzle the way my imagination played out.  The bar even works functionally and has some character.  Highly recommend if your are in the Arcadia area.	4 star
	Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!	2 star
	The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try.	1 star
	Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.\n\nWatch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.	4 star
	Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\n\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.	3 star
	The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!	4 star
	I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!	3 star
	I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!	0 star
	I have been to Mary for facials seeking clear skin for 9 years.  Yes my skin looks great.  She always has the latest and best products and treatments.  Mary 's salon is always a place of welcome and relaxation.  She takes time to evaluate my skin each session.	4 star
	I'm torn. They have great deals at times, like buy 1 get 2 free packages of boneless skinless chicken breasts. But they also have crappy bread and produce, last time I went there the strawberries I bought that looked fine rotted within a day, the tortillas all stuck together and the bread went moldy. I didn't save my receipt because I have never had to return anything to a grocery store before.. I guess I will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals.	1 star
	No matter how many times they call (nearly every day for the last few months!) and no matter how many times I tell them I am not interested and to please STOP CALLING - they continue to harass - calls come in from 8am until 9pm.  Based on these business practices alone I will never use them.	0 star
