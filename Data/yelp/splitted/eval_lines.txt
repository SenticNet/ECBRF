	Do you enjoy loud, cramped coffee shops? If so, this is the place for you. Whether it is 4 PM on a weekday afternoon or evening on a lazy Sunday, this place is always packed like a can of sardines. The coffee is great and the service friendly, but it is evident that you're in Shadyside. For a less crazy feel, head over to their Bakery Square location.\n\nTip: try their Sumatra blend	2 star
	Lots of seating area, open windows and coffee related gifts. I ordered the chai and wanted it without sugar but they gave me a sugar free version with sugar substitute.	2 star
	i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch, ect.  to top it all off the place didn't have my garmets back the day they said they would.  so, i had to make another trip across town to pick them up.  where are the $1.95 per garmet dry cleaning shops in pittsburgh?  this place is out of my dry cleaning budget!	1 star
	Very nice inside with a great atmosphere.   Turn around was quick and staff was friendly.  I got a white comforter dry cleaned and while it didn't as clean as I had hoped, it was cleaner, smelled great, and was wrapped up neatly.	3 star
	What can I say about a laundromat? It's clean and well staffed, no creepy dark corners, the machines are maintained and cleaned, and there's free parking with a little japanese grocer next door.  It's a little more expensive than a regular laundromat, but worth it.	4 star
	Came to this location based on other popular Yelp reviews and was very satisfied. The location is very clean and reasonably priced. The staff seemed very friendly although I did not have to personally interact with them. One issue might be availability of machines during peak times. My visit was around 3:00pm on a Saturday and I had no issues. There is free WIFI too! Overall, very pleased and I will definitely visit again.	4 star
	Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless.	4 star
	I do wash and fold. I've never used a wash a fold service before in my life, so as far as I can tell nothing has ever been lost or damaged, things are clean, done quickly-- so for that I'd say 4 stars\n\nBUT I would not recommend their dry cleaning. Things I've had dry cleaned there have been mis-colored, or stains remain.	2 star
	If i could give this place less than one star I would.  First, the place is a mess.  Second, the washers are some of the most expensive I've found in the city.  But most important - they have NO RESTROOMS!  What kind of place sends their customers a block down the street to a coffee shop to use the restroom?  This was my first AND LAST time at this joint.	0 star
	i'm a total fan of eons. love their selection! a little pricey though.	3 star
	Sometimes I come all the way to Pittsburgh from Akron JUST to visit Eons.  The employees are friendly & knowledgeable.  The clothing is very well organized, separated by era and then by size.  This is one of the only vintage clothing stores I've been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items, complete with their original tags.  The dresses I have purchased here are absolutely amazing, many of them never worn.  I will continue to visit on my quarterly P-burgh visits!	4 star
	I lovvvvve this place. It's really well organized, employees are friendly, and I never leave without buying something. Last time I was here I got two necklaces (the jewelry is great), a quilted jacket, and a blazer with polka dot lining.\n\nI always make a stop here when I'm back in Pittsburgh.	4 star
	Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop.	4 star
	Good selection, well organized, friendly staff!  \n\nOn my quest to explore Pittsburgh, I stopped by Eons and ended up trying on a few things.  I wasn't really on a quest to find anything though, but I could see myself spending hours in there shuffling through all the racks.	3 star
	Mostly 1960s-1980s stuff. A few pieces from the 1940s and 1950s and nothing earlier (clothes-wise anyway, they did have mesh purses from the 1920s). Lots of menswear; suits and dress shirts. The store is about half men's stuff and half women's stuff. The clothes seem to be fairly high quality (ie. not stained or ripped) but you pay for it. They did have some cute outfits, but it was priced too high for me.	2 star
	A nice place to stop in if you're out for a stroll in shadyside. Though I think this place is overpriced and a bit overrated, the staff is always nice and you can discover some pretty good finds. Obviously much better for women's clothes	2 star
	You simply have to visit this shop, they have the best quality vintage clothing and really excellent customer service.  The store feels cramped, but then again it is packed with a great selection of vintage clothes.  Everything is laid out very logically, and the prices are quite reasonable, especially given the quality.  \n\nIn particular, you will find a great selection of men's bow ties, and I have looked unsuccessfully for these at other stores.\n\nOne more thing, the owner supports the local community, he is continually helping out non-profits by donating or loaning merchandise and by publicizing their events.	4 star
	I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed.	1 star
	I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.	0 star
	Do not use this cleaner.  Quality is poor. They ruined three shirts of mine, tore two of them and shrunk another down. Refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss. They do not stand by their mistakes.	0 star
	Have been waiting for +10 business shirts and suits for over 2 weeks. The manager is uncertain whether my clothes will be ready in another week or two. \n\nThe last batch of dry cleaning came back pressed with wrinkles. Had to send it back. \n\nCustomer service is poor. \n\nI would strongly recommend you not use Owen's Dry Cleaners.	0 star
	This place is terrible.  Customer service is sub-par.  I took 10 shirts in on a saturday.  They were supposed to be ready on the following thursday, 5 days later.  I went to pick them up on monday, NINE days later and they still weren't done.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I have a card to have 5 shirts laundered for free and i'm throwing it away.	0 star
	THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place.	4 star
	Only went here for drinks, but very impressed.  Sidecar was very strong, but not too strong that it wasn't drinkable.  The waiter had a ton of knowledge about different drinks they could serve.  \n\nOverall great atmosphere - young, talkative, fun crowd.  I would definitely like to go back again and try the food.	3 star
	A great way to spend the night.  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles.   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed.  Would love to try everything on the menu.	4 star
	I don't see the big deal about Soba Lounge. I thought the food was only okay, and I didn't like all of the flavors overpowering each other. The ambience is really nice, and the servers are friendly, but the food was just alright for me.	1 star
	So underwhelming. I've been here a few times and have always been disappointed. Last night the service was especially lackluster. And the kitchen closed and 10, so no snacks for us later in the evening . They do make a good French Martini though.	1 star
	So the majority of my food was good here, appetizer (King Edward Mussels), dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance, but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver.	1 star
	If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur. \n\nBy far the best espresso martini in the city!\n\nThey also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!\n\nSoba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!	4 star
	I give this place an OKAY because I've had mixed experiences. The first time I went it was okay, but was very forgettable.\n\nThe last time I went, we were seated outside on the balcony, and the outdoor heating was nice, our waiter was polite and well spoken. The only thing was that our food took... forever... to come. When we asked about the status of our order, the food came right away.\n\nIn terms of food, they have a pretty good selection, but... once again forgettable. It's a nice and casual place to go but don't expect more.	1 star
	I went to Soba with some co-workers on a work trip to Pittsburgh. The wine selection was pretty impressive (there was something for every taste) and the food was good. Not the best pad thai I've ever eaten (pretty dry, like it had been sitting a while) but my co-workers enjoyed their meals. Would go back again if I were in the area.	2 star
	Soba is hit or miss for me. The cocktails are awesome, particularly when $6 during happy hour. You can't beat lavendar syrups and St Germain. I've had some great dishes - the corn soup and the pad thai- but some have flopped. The lamb stew, for example, had delicious flavor but besides the veggies was almost inedible because the lamb was tough as leather. I feel like mistakes like this shouldn't happen at these prices.	2 star
	I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok, a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing, but it was better.  \n\nThe kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes, it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far.	1 star
	Loved it! Great vibe.	4 star
	The bar and restaurant has nice decor. Very upbeat. The calamari was good but not exceptional. The Chaing Mai curry was so spicy hot I couldn't eat it. The service was unattentive.  Has potential but presently over rated.	2 star
	Love love love this place. They did an amazing job. Favorite place for happy hour.	4 star
	Ambience was beautiful but main dishes were not as good as appetizers. Rice was incredibly salty, and the duck was \"recommended\" to be cooked medium rare, however it was terribly rubbery and fatty. The sauce was good though. It took 45 minutes for us to get our check. \n\nGo for drinks, not for meal	2 star
	Went to Soba to celebrate my sons birthday. Quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price. We have eaten there several times in the past but not sure that we will be going back anytime soon.	1 star
	I came here around 9:30 pm on a Friday and had a reservation even though there appeared to be some open tables. The drinks are worth it, especially the offer you can't refuse drink-I had two. The food is alright. I had the pork and shrimp fried rice. I've definitely had better thai food in other restaurants at a much lower price..but come for the atmosphere, I suppose.	2 star
	Amazing food, lovely atmosphere. Lot of the menu changes seasonally. We probably come here twice a month. I try to avoid ordering the same thing over an over (the fillet mignon is just outstanding), and I have never been disappointed.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it for a date or even a group night out.\n\nThe upstairs covered patio area is great in the summer time.	4 star
	The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years, and that statement stands.\n\nJust fabulous.	4 star
	I found the food here to be there. The atmosphere in Decor was spectacular however. I ordered the seared tuna and the sides were delicious, but the tuna was average. I also ordered the ice cream sandwiches for dessert and was not overly impressed... although they were good, they were not at the level I had expected.	3 star
	My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The crispy  tofu there is so amazing! My next best dish is the thakkali curry.. The drinks specially the Asian plum sangria is fantastic.. Love the ambience! It's like a place in New York. Good veggie options.	4 star
	AMAZING! we had such a sublime experience here.  Service was wonderful, efficient, not fussy or intrusive.  The food?  Awesome!  We started with the crispy calamari and the crystal dumplings (?) or whatever they were called.  Both were delicious.\n\nJohn had the bibimbap and I had the duck, which we both agreed was the best duck we'd ever had.  Just perfect.\n\nWe're not big on desserts, but it was a special occasion, so we splurged.  John had the terrine and I had the ice cream sandwich, both very nice endings to a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to go again!	4 star
	Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted, seriously.\nExcellent Thai Corn Chowder.\nIncredible Black Cod.\nThis place does Asian Fusion well!	4 star
	Johnnie knows exactly what to do with my hair, and as always it turns out fabulous! I've had bad experiences with hair cuts, but here I can always trust the staff!	4 star
	Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushi/sashimi is what makes the difference.\n\nThe black cod dish is unbelievable.	4 star
	Ate here for the first time, very impressed, let the chef chose and we were very pleased with the taste, selection and presentation.  Will be back!	3 star
	According to the Pittsburgh Magazine, this is supposedly one of the best 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Clearly they have never been out of their city, county or state. I suggest they take a trip to Philly and try some of the good Japanese food. Regardless, the snapper/fluke/yellowtail yuzu jalape\u00f1o is a nice touch, but not a must try. Service is sketchy here at best.	1 star
	Yummy Asian Fusion. Delicious Cocktails. Cool Ambiance.	3 star
	Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor.	0 star
	Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced	0 star
	I do not see what all of the fuss is about - maybe it is due to the lack of authentic bagel options in the area? I agree that their bagels are authentic, and the lox sandwich is pretty darn good with an ample amount of each of the toppings. Everything else is pretty average to me, and the service has been below average on each of my several visits. I will go back and try some different pastries, and will hopefully have a positive update.	2 star
	The food at this location was about the same as at the Squirrel Hill location on Forbes Avenue (not bad, not great), but I thought the service was far worse. One of the male employees helping us referred to one of the females as an \"old hag\" which I thought was extremely unprofessional and uncool. I'm sure he was joking, but that's still not something he should have said around customers. This tainted the whole experience for me and I probably won't be returning. My dining partner agreed.	1 star
	Don't come here from NYC looking for a good bagel and lox, stick w the ice cream.	1 star
	A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!	3 star
	Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.	1 star
	I'm not totally sure why I keep going back here. The place is tiny and dirty. It was super busy and only 2 employees were making food. The owner was on the register but kept leaving to do other things because they were so short-staffed. I felt bad for how overwhelmed the staff must have been, but they worked as fast as they could. \n\nThe food's okay and overpriced. The coffee's terrible. The seating area is crowded. The location on Craig street has had mice and roaches. \n\nThere aren't many bagel places in Pittsburgh, but Brueggers and Einstein's win.	1 star
	Nice!  Spacious outdoor patio in the front, but it tends to fill up fast.  That's ok, though, because the inside is comfortable as well and has two floors, the second of which contains a lounge area with couches.  Interesting beer selection, all pretty high quality in my humble opinion.  Our waitress kicked butt, and was friendly enough to chat with us for a few minutes each time she came by.  The burger I ordered was about two inches thick and very tasty.  Our shared pierogies and hummus with pita vanished within minutes.	3 star
	I go to Harris most every week for happy hour, which features excellent half-price wings (I like the \"Colombian Gum Numbers\") and beers.  The atmosphere is very classy, and there's  a nice patio to sit on when the weather's pleasant.  I never go outside of happy hour, though, because it's just too damn expensive.  $6 beers?  $6 for 6 wings?  Why do hipsters like overpaying for things?  I don't know, but they must, as this place is always packed to the gills with them.	2 star
	Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting.	1 star
	A quick bar update: when I was here over the weekend, I noticed that they are now offering a frozen mimosa with Sunday brunch.  During my visit, they were also offering a new cocktail on special.  It consisted of fresh muddled watermelon.  There were even seeds in the glass!  It was tasty and novel, but the amount of triple sec made it too sweetly acidic.	3 star
	Harris grill is lively, unpretentious, and has good food. Its patio is a great place to linger on a warm evening, and the bar and restaurant are good places for cheap food on colder winter nights.	3 star
	only a stupid, spoiled, new york shiksa such as myself would order something on the menu called a latke at a place like this (\"the boxty\").  it was disgusting and didnt resemble any latke i have ever seen.  \n\nlucky me, i had about 4 bloody marys during the hour wait for my table so I was full anyway.	1 star
	My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching, or the back patio for a nice quiet and private drink.  Good brunch turns great once the patios are closed, as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte.  This brings about the Breakfast Smil... err, Simile.  Home fries, bacon, sausage, eggs, and pancakes all on one giant plate.	4 star
	This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored.	1 star
	Appearance is best\nThe drinks and food don't live up\nTo expectations.\n\n\n(b)	1 star
	Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups, and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching \"comfortable\").  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!\n\nThey'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas.	1 star
	Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice, what more could you ask for? A waitress that doesn't seem to care about any of this? Wish granted!\n\nSo yeah, my food was pretty bland, though my girlfriend said her food was OK overall. Overpriced for what it really was.\n\nI may have come back if it wasn't for the first two items. Instead I'll leave them as a shining failure to customer service.	0 star
	Yummy, love that they integrate local ingredients.  Lunch menu affordable.	3 star
	Great drinks (frozen cosmos!!) but the food and service leaves something to be desired. Try the Sunday brunch!	2 star
	A pleasant enough little place for \"Hipster Yinzers\" to engage in those unique conversations where everyone talks simultaneously and loudly and no one is heard. The fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks, meager portions and lackluster service.  Oddly, everyone seems to rave about their tater tots......yeah, the same processed frozen spud you enjoyed in elementary/parochial school.	1 star
	I had the tomato soup (around $3.50) and a side order of macaroni and cheese (around $4.50). The tomato soup is very peppery, so if you don't like things spicy at all, don't order it. The macaroni was quite good. I also tried the potato and cheese pierogies (around $7.50), which I liked, but it was my first time trying pierogies, so I can't compare them to anything.\n\nThe waitstaff was quite pleasant.\n\nThe restaurant was noisy, so possibly not the best place for people who are hard of hearing.	2 star
	I am giving Harris 4 stars because it is my neighborhood bar and has sentimental value to me. Minus that, it is probably a 3.5. They have a stellar frozen cosmo but the rest of the drink menu is just okay. Their food menu is a hit or miss. Their turkey burger and mac'n'cheese are great but the rest is probably just okay. Their desserts are unimpressive and it is hard to underwhelm me when it comes to sugar. So I would say, go for the atmosphere and the cosmo but not for much more.	3 star
	I've visited Harris's Grill a few times over the past 3 - 4 years and every time I leave I ask myself \"Why do people love this  place so much!?\" The food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best. Minus the bacon gimmicks and pretentious Shadyside vibe... This place is an average bar/restaurant.	1 star
	The food here is good. Nothing too interesting on the menu though. Reasonably priced, too. \nMy favorite thing about this place, and what keeps me coming back, is their frozen cosmos. Soooo satisfying on a hot day. Beware - too many can ruin your night. These babies are super strong.\nTheir beer list is great and their other mixed drinks are really interesting combinations.	2 star
	The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. \nI tried the pasta once and it was tasteless.	1 star
	Went for the first time today. Kitchen was just wrapping up a re-model, but they extended happy hour to accommodate and the food was pretty darn good.\n\nThe happy hour specials were a great deal and the staff was really nice. Also love that the patio is in the shade all afternoon/evening. Great summer spot.	3 star
	I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent.	1 star
	Harris is the best.  Good beer, good bar food, good juke box, decent outdoor seating and all of the Pittsburgh charm you would want from your bartenders, servers and management.  It's my go-to bar when I'm in the Burgh. \n\nIt's a bar; it's a good bar--if you're looking for life changing event I would recommend staying home and punching yourself in the face, since you're likely a Nickelback loving douche.	4 star
	If you have a sense of humor, if you love frozen cosmopolitans or if you're just looking for a fun, casual place to get your grub on, Harris Grill is where it's at. I recommend the Henny Penny, but be adventurous; they are always changing their menu to incorporate a plethora of ingredients, so you're bound to find something you love. Plus, they've got a sweet outdoor patio for the warmer days. \n\nMake sure to spend some time with the menu. It's a riot. Brilliant!	3 star
	This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio. I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the Pittsburgh salad. I would totally recommend getting any of the salads. The steak salad looked amazing (the people next to us got it) and the Pittsburgh salad tasted delicious. My sandwich was fine, but nothing to write home about. Overall, it was a good experience and will most likely be back.	3 star
	Harris Grill is 100% OK. The service is nice, the drink list is nice, the menu (albeit confusing) is nice, and my overall experience has been...err...nice.\n\nEverything is a little expensive, and I don't really understand the menu (are they joking in some places? Is it supposed to be serious? Why is everything priced awkwardly?), but they have a solid brew list and the outdoor seating is crucial.\n\nTake a date here, take a group here, or come on a Sunday morning for their brunch (which is also nice).	2 star
	The frozen cosmos and mimosas are great, especially on special during happy hour. They also have a great list of beers and other cocktails. \nThe menu is a little creative but has mostly basic bar food. If salad is your thing you must get the one with beets and goat cheese.	3 star
	Great evening. \nBasics:\nGreat service, \nVery good food..hamburger Helper ( not like I remembered )\nVery good beer with pumpkin for my wife and met with her approval!\nDesert ...homemade cookie with Ice cream and whipped cream was perfect\nCheers	3 star
	Great brunch deal! There will be a line if you arrive later than 11 am on Sunday because a 15-bucks buffet that has tons of wonderful food and one free coffee or juice or Bloody Mary just sounds so damn good! I love their waffles and egg Benny!	3 star
	I stay 2 blocks away from Harris Grill. I have been to shiloh's grill as well, a caouple of times. Harris Grill used to make awesome food an year ago..now its just boiled vegetablea..steak cut out for you..who would want that!!!!	1 star
	PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!\n\nBurger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. \n\nService was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. \n\nKinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all, and there is some interesting religious art work on the walls.	3 star
	I like this store, can't say I LOVE it.  They have a decent selection, kind of small and limited, I feel.  The mens clothes leaves much lacking, however on a weekend it's nice to browse here for some good finds.  I've gotten a lot of neat scarves, jewelry and a couple dresses here.  Overall it's a lot better (and pricier) than the local goodwills.	3 star
	I have been a member for a year. Pretty crowded, lot of machines that do not work and not open all time during week ends. Obviously, compared to a $10 membership at Planet Fitness, the choice is quick ... The reason you would stick to this gym is the classes. If you want a spin class or a yoga class, it coul dbe worth it. If you are only looking for treadmill and machines, membership cost is not worth it.	1 star
	Great location but low on amenities.  HVAC system is ancient and the noise factor on Fifth Avenue is problematic. The price is nice but that's all I can say about the positive.	1 star
	Nothing special about this place. Great location but the facilities are a little tired.	1 star
	This place is awesome. Immaculately clean, lots of natural light in every room of the enormous suites, modern decor, great location, and amazing customer service. You really feel like you are at home. Such a wonderful experience. I will definitely be a returning guest.	4 star
	We stopped here for a bite to eat before going out drinking.  The food was good (I had the fish sandwich, which was huge.  and I enjoyed the batter on the fish), but the service was terrible.  Bad service takes away from a good meal.  The fact that the prices were so low was one redeeming factor to save it from a 3 star rating.	2 star
	Came here for dinner on my birthday (back before I turned 21) and also when my parents were in town for dinner.  The food was decent each time, but nothing really standout.  I enjoyed my fish and chips, but my boyfriend didn't care much for his pasta--too rich and overwhelming.  I like the homey decor a lot, though!  It really feels like a neighborhood place.  Coming from the suburbs, I'd never seen restaurants done like that (except tacky imitations).\n\nLuckily for students and other carfree residents, it's on the 71C route and close to the 71A!	3 star
	Extensive wine menu and average service.  They have an in-house wine specialist that helps you with your wine selection - impressive. The food is the high point of this place. They always seem to have a great selection of seasonal foods - gnoochi stuffed with sweet potatoes and topped with goat cheese and cranberries. \n\nWhen warm weather gets here, stop by and check out the outdoor patio. It's a nice place for a summertime date.	3 star
	We came in here for after dinner drinks and although the ambiance was very focused on the basketball game going on, we had a great time.  Notably the service is great, and although we spilled one beer and broke a glass (no we were not inebriated, just excited and gesturing) the waitress was lovely and accomodating.  Apparently they have great lobster and a yummy burger so that too would be fun to try.	2 star
	use to be a max and erma's and if that bar wasn't low enough it now misses the mark	1 star
	I'm not legal to drink but each time I've been here the food has been normal--make sure you check out their dessert menu though--it's divine. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and romantic with dim lighting and a lot of  pretty lights.  Service is a bit slow, but they were able to accommodate for twelve people without reservations in 20 minutes, so no complaints there!	2 star
	Overall, I like Elbow Room. Food is definitely hit or miss. Here's what I've learned: Avoid any sort of seafood! There is an excellent selection of burgers and they are very customizable. The salads here are better than the average entree salad at other establishments. Desserts, made in-house from scratch, are delicious and enough for two people to split. But what keeps me coming back to Elbow Room is their late night (after 9PM) $5 martini specials. Combined with the ambiance, it's okay to feel classy. Definitely a nice getaway from most of the pubs that line Walnut.	2 star
	Everything about our experience was wonderful!!  We had made a reservation because we had a large party - our table was ready and waiting for us (this was a Friday night about 6:30). Our waitress was friendly and kept up with our many requests - from drinks to appetizers to dinner.  The food all came out together - (we had salads, burgers, seafood entree) so there was a variety and everyone was pleased with their dinners.  Will definitely go back!!	4 star
	I have been here once for drinks and once for lunch. A really great place to go if your parents are visiting (it's a bar sans the rowdy crowd).  We ordered some soup, salads, and Bloody Mary's and enjoyed conversation while being waited on by a super friendly staff.\n\nBloody Mary could have used more of a kick	2 star
	\"Bland\" is probably the key word in describing this place. A local Applebees-type feel.\n\nI was here for dinner one night, and the sandwich I got was unbelievably bland, so was the side of cole slaw. The artichoke dip was ok, but very greasy. The pasta a bit dry and bland as well.\n\nThe reverse happy hour concept from 9PM-11PM is cool. There is an OK number of beers on tap. The service is friendly and efficient.\n\nHowever, the food is sub-par, so I won't be returning even if I were in the area.	1 star
	Drinks are good but food sucks. I tried the food multiple times and I think only the french onion soup and salads are descent. The main courses are very low quality.	1 star
	Wonderful brunch. The food and service was great. The waiters were very friendly and the food wasn't too pricey. Really a great option for brunch.	3 star
	Desert was great - beer was good.  Food was under seasoned a bit with out the sauce.  Husband liked it with.	2 star
	Came upon this restaurant when I was at the Apple store. It was a Tuesday night and the place was not that crowded. I ordered the salmon and overall it was good. The gnocchi that came with it was yummy. The bartender was very nice and friendly. The guy who owns the restaurant his dad and buddy were also at the bar and they were a fun bunch at the bar. Would defiantly come back especially for drinks. Great bar place to hang out at.	3 star
	Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \"cheers\" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad, but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend, and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't \"special\". If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville, then I want more bang for my buck.	1 star
	This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!	4 star
	Always enjoy coming to The Elbow Room. Atmosphere is great. Food is great. Jason was our server. He did an excellent job! Highly recommend asking for Jason.	4 star
	My friends and I found ourselves here because of the crowds for the Jam of Walnut Street. We went there on a recommendation from friends for their happy hour martinis. From 9-11PM, their martinis are half off. My friends and I enjoy the Purple Rain. The drinks are strong and affordable. I will be coming back for their martinis and will have to try their food next time!	3 star
	The Elbow Room exceeded my expectations.  The Novemburger was creative and flavor full.  Lunch time on a Saturday seemed quiet though, and the ambiance seemed to be lacking a certain something.	2 star
	I ordered the prosciutto with asparagus as my appetizer. I really enjoyed its flavor alone, but the damn balsamic vinegar ruined it. Just keep things simple!\n\nI had the turkey Granny Smith Apple (George Washington) sandwich. They had unfortunately ran out of Brie cheese so I didn't have the sandwich as how it was meant to be. Nevertheless, it was really delicious. Very unique!	2 star
	I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great, but styled horribly. When I left I literally looked like I was wearing a wig from the early '90's. Once I was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, I really loved it. The third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. I just hate it, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!	1 star
	If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon.	0 star
	Krista is a hair wizard. Not only do I love the cut and colour of my hair I love how well informed she keeps me about everything she's doing to my hair. Her product knowledge is out of this world and she seems to really love making people look good. I would never trust anyone else with my hair.	4 star
	Food is mediocre but the wing specials and flavors are decent.\n\nThe beer specials are pretty good.  It has a dive bar feel despite being in the heart of Shadyside, which is a nice change of pace if that's what you are looking for.  The TV situation for sports isn't the best, but there are quite a few TV's and you should be able to catch the game from wherever you are seated.\n\nThe outdoor patio/bar is a nice touch in Summer.	2 star
	Great food and normally great atmosphere, but today thus music was the nastiest hardcore rap that was just offensive. How many F-bombs can you realistically listen to while eating lunch and watching sports. Dropped 2 stars from what I would last night whenit used to be my favorite place in shadyside.	1 star
	Weirdest nights ever.\nWormhole tequila black-out.\nToo crowded/hot/cold.\n\n(b)	1 star
	The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.	0 star
	Review base on wings n beer! Been here a couple of times now. I always seem to come when they have wings on special. Which works out great for me because I love wings, and their wings are so tasty! I particularly like the kitchen sink wings, but they have multiple yummy flavors. They are a great price and always have some kind of beer deal. Perfect lunch spot on Sunday. Service is ok, but they are always pretty busy place.	3 star
	Haven't tried the wings yet, will try next time. Went there two days in a roll for drinks. Like the patio because it' s nice weather.	2 star
	Great beer and food specials.  They had the Michigan game on too!	2 star
	It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good, but the bad hip-hop was too loud to be worth staying for more than one glass	1 star
	If you're drunk get the kitchen sink wings and mac & cheese bites! Their fried zucchini is pretty good too :)	3 star
	Do you like sports, beer, and fried pub grub and sandwiches? How about Shadyside? \n\nAnswering yes to these questions would probably mean you already know about the Tav, but should you not, this might be your place. \n\nAdmittedly, it's not one of my regular spots, but I'll submit that when an occasion calls for multiple screens of sports, copious amounts of food and booze, and a energetic atmosphere, the Tavern hits the spot.	2 star
	A typical sports bar in Shadyside. I've only been here once a couple years ago, but from what I remember the beer selection was pretty good, and the quality of the food is about par. To be honest, I prefer watching the game elsewhere, hence why I haven't been back. However, I'd recommend a stop-in sometime to see if the place and vibe tickle your fancy.	2 star
	Good little place to hang out, watch a game, have a drink, etc.  We stopped in on a game night for a drink, and it was not too loud and not too packed.  The drinks were a good price, the service was good and the crowd was cool.  I'm not sure what else I could say about it... decent place to grab a beverage!	2 star
	This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best, less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative.	1 star
	Best bar on Walnut.\nGo here anytime of day,\nThey will have your fix.\n\n(b)	3 star
	Can't comment on food since I was just in for beers.  \n\nOkay crowd, friendly bartender, okay beer selection, but it's pretty tacky, and not really in a good way.  Looks like the last time any money was put into the place was maybe 1979.	1 star
	Cappy's provides a welcome relief from the high prices on Shadyside's posh Walnut Street shopping and dining district.  The food isn't great, but it isn't bad either, and the prices for food and drink won't break the bank.  The menu also boasts quite a few options, and anyone looking for standard bar fare in this increasingly ritzy area may find a haven at Cappy's.  I'd never call this place delicious or wonderful, but I certainly wouldn't want it closing up shop either.	2 star
	I was surprised how good the food was. Great service very friendly people.	3 star
	Avg food, too salty.	1 star
	Food is.decent. karoake is the best I've gone to in a long time. The place is super small.though. that is the biggest disadvantage and why I give it 3 stars. You are practically sitting on top of people.	2 star
	I've been eating here on and off for the better part of two decades. There's nothing really special about the food, but it's full of good reliable staples. The coffee is always fresh and the Bloody Mary's are very good. Plenty of horseradish if you want it!	2 star
	I must be jaded since I came from Boston where the Bakeries are excellent.  I heard through the grape vine that the roasted almond torte was excellent so we bought some and brought it home.  The salty sweet toasted almond coating was excellent, but the fluffy cake with some type of pudding between the layers was mediocre at best.  I hate it when bakeries make awful cake because it seems to me that is an easy item to get right.  I will give them another chance but so far I would say they are average.	2 star
	I really like the signature toasted almond cake, but have been mostly disappointed with the other things I've tried here. I've also not been pleased with the employees - they're not very friendly.	2 star
	Yum! I just picked up a cookie platter ($32...see photo) for a party and it looks awesome. Can't wait to have my guests drool over the buttery goodness that are Prantls' cookies. \n\nOther than the treats, this place makes some really decent bread. I've tried it a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed. If you live in Shadyside, make sure to check this place out.\n\n...oh and they sell Enrico's biscottis. Can't go wrong with those!	3 star
	Come here for the jelly sandwich cookies. BEST jelly sandwich cookies ever. they're round, 2 layers, powdered sugar, and you can see the jam in a little cut out circle on the top layer. Their \"burnt almond torte cake\" is supposed to be really famous, but i always got distracted by the cookies...	4 star
	I came in here looking for an Italian loaf to serve with dinner at around 2 PM and was rudely informed by the girl at the counter that they were sold out of pretty much anything of the sort.\n\nDisappointed, but being new to Pittsburgh, I got a small \"bar\" version of the famous burnt almond torte.  \n\nRegardless of the bad service, I'll be back for another piece of almond torte...it was that awesome.	3 star
	Wow! Their burnt almond torte is a Pittsburgh staple, and the few other things that I've tried from them have been equally delicious! I highly recommend checking out this bakery.	3 star
	I generally am not a fan of baked goods. HOWEVER, Prantl's has me coming back and wanting more.\n\nThe toasted almond cups are to die for. GET. THEM. I believe it's a mini version of their burnt almond torte? Either way, ah-mazing.\n\nI even liked their donuts! I never eat donuts. The only donuts I ever liked in my life were Krispy Kreme's original glazed donuts. After KK died, I have never enjoyed a donut since. However, today at Prantl's, their glazed donut was calling to me. Ohmygosh. I devoured that thing in literally five seconds.\n\nIn one word, yum.	4 star
	Too sweet. Tried the famous almond cake and some cupcakes. Cannot even finish eating them. Plus, the stuff there are rude, maybe just because there are too many customers in the little place.	2 star
	I don't even like cake, but, the best dessert I have ever had is the Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's! It is so delicious, nothing compares!	4 star
	Nothing stood out, including the famous burnt almond torte.	1 star
	too sweet for me	2 star
	Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's: crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place. Not half as good as a few of the French etc bakeries around. Why waste your cardiovascular health on this place--go get gelato next door and you'll be better off!	1 star
	The cinnamon rolls are so good. They are almost half cream cheese icing which is delicious. Plan to be in a sugar coma afterward but its so worth it! The red velvet looked good but I felt too guilty to order more after ordering all five of the cinnamon rolls they had left :)	4 star
	If you want to get pastries while being yelled at by the staff and treated like dirt, this is the place for you.	0 star
	While I still like the almond torte, I just can't justify my original rating when the overall selections are just subpar. After trying a larger selection of their baked goods, especially the mini cake cups, I realized they all look delicious but when you bite into them, they're really dry and full of generic cake frosting. \nIf you're still tempted to get one,  go with the tiramisu since it has the redeeming factor of having a strong coffee flavor.	1 star
	After falling in love with the burnt almond torte while living in PGH, we wanted to have it at our California wedding.  Recent publicity meant they were not able to ship the cakes for us.  \n\nThankfully they were very responsive to email questions and requests and made it very easy for a friend to ship the cakes for us.  They arrived in perfect condition and were delicious.	4 star
	Amazing pastries! Gotta go and check it out.  We had the almond tort, cream horn and the gob. All great! Reasonable prices too.	4 star
	Oh, baked almond torte, how I love you. Why, though, must you be so caloric!?!  It distresses me that I must save you for special occasions.	4 star
	Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. \n\nI generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.\n\nGenerally unfriendly staff, but Walnut St. attracts pretty arrogant customers - so it makes sense.	3 star
	Pros: Friendly service, cookies were yummy, portions are generous\nCons: Coffee smoothie resembled more of a slushee, ice cream was way too soft (melted pretty much as soon as we started eating it)\n\nConclusion: I'm willing to stop by again just for the cookies (but only if I'm already in the neighborhood). Also, looking forward to trying their coffee the next time around.	2 star
	Jitters definitely has good coffee and ice cream, but as others noted, the service can be a little hit or miss.  The ice cream here is hand made without any preservatives.  The baked goods are from Prantl's, so they're localy sourced.  In the fall and winter they have a good pumpkin spice latte.\n\nOne thing I noticed:  theyhaven't updated their website in awhile.	2 star
	This is by far my favorite place to get coffee ever. If you are a student, or maybe a recent graduate in need of Internet this is the place to go. Grab a coffee and grab a seat inside or outside and enjoy using the Internet as long as you like. NO TIME LIMIT!	4 star
	This place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners. It used to be simple to buy coffee. They used to have a white mocha but not anymore. I miss the old owner of the place. \nBut still support small caf\u00e9s!!!	0 star
	Their coffee is solid--better than coffee tree roasters, imo--and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Prefer this place over the local chains any day.	4 star
	A decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. Decent coffee, tasty bagels, and so-so bagel sandwiches. I've tried several of their sandwiches and been disappointed, but I'd still recommend this location overall. Try the upstairs seating; it's divine.	2 star
	Let it be known that I am the biggest Bruegger's fan ever.  I've been a pretty steady once-a-weeker since childhood.\n\nAfter all that...This is the worst Bruegger's ever.  I always think: Oh, I'm close by and it'll be fine this time.  Nope.  The staff is awful.  The bagel are stale.  The staff is so awful they don't know that the bagels are stale.\n\nProtect your brand, Bruegger's, and get a new staff for this location.	2 star
	Haven't been to a Brueggers in years.  This one has a great location and is probably one of the only fast service style restaurants in Walnut Street area.  \n\nWhile I was here I just had a simple everything bagel toasted w/cream cheese.  It hit the spot.  Still as good as I remember them.	2 star
	The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option, and the produce is always fresh. Skinny bagels have become quite the trend, and Brueggers does it justice. At times, the coffee can be mediocre, but the bagels are always fresh, and Brueggers really is a Pittsburgh staple. A skinny zesty egg white breakfast sandwich is the perfect way to go for a lite breakfast.	3 star
	Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this \"employee.\" I will not return.	0 star
	Stop in here for all of your overpriced candles, orchids, and meditation books and scented everythings. Although I probably would never purchase anything here, it's a nice little shop owned by a couple of nice guys in the heart of Shadyside that's good to stop in when you're in the neighborhood. The ambience here is the highlight, with an aroma of goodness and soft soothing music playing in the background. Sometimes the owners have their dog resting at the foot of the counter, which is another highlight for me!	2 star
	Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles.	4 star
	Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut.	4 star
	If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift, this is the place for you.\n\nAlso: a strategically hip book selection, high quality puppets, a wall of giggle-worthy novelty shirts and a jewelry case.  Oh, and KARDS.\n\nFound along the wall: bacon band-aids, insta-Irish accent mouth spray, famous philosopher finger puppets, librarian action figure, vulgar piggie banks, zombie plastic animals, etc.  A tiny sampling of the silliness.	3 star
	They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like \"While you were out\" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!	4 star
	This is where I go when I can't think of a gift for someone. The store isn't particularly large, but there is such an array of cards, books, tees, stationery, soaps, and dozens of other uncategorizable things. They stock a great selection of books-- nearly every one is compelling, and I never feel like I'm sifting through a lot of less interesting books to find the best ones. The editions are always nicely designed. There is also a great collection of shirts, including Pittsburgh shirts that only a Pittsburgher would understand.	3 star
	Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again.	3 star
	The store is really fun, just know it gets crowded quickly, especially around the holidays. Don't recommend going with a stroller in tow!	3 star
	Amazing!\n\nI recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. \n\nA++++!!!	4 star
	First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING	4 star
	I love this little grocer. They prepare little bentos (perfect for lunch while you do your laundry) and have a ton of niche items you can't get anywhere else. Plus, the produce and seafood is some of the best in the city. If you haven't found this place, then stay away, I don't want my selection lessening.	4 star
	It should be a 3.5. The bento box is tasty and they offered 10% off until the end of the year. But we were there around 2:00 pm. There were not a lot of selections for bento boxes. Maybe we should go earlier next time.	2 star
	This Japanese food store has a nice selection of East Asian goods which are tougher to find in the East End. For example, I was able to find sushi grade fish, seaweed sheets, uni, pickled carrots, and green tea ice cream.\n\nUnfortunately, I left the store empty handed because they did not have ice prepared to pack the fish in so that the fish would remain at a safe temperature during my trip home.	2 star
	Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side.	4 star
	This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake, all the time.\n\nI only go in to buy six packs.  The bar staff seems nice enough.  It def seems like a frat crowd.\n\nThey get 2 stars only bc there is a skee ball machine.	1 star
	I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that.	0 star
	If they actually actually kept the store stocked, this would be a 4 star review.  However, I fight the traffic, parking lot, people with baskets, elevator, and rest of the customers to get to the bulk spices, Mexican section & produce only to find 100% of the things I need not stocked. So incredibly frustrating!\n  They do have a nice cheese section, bakery, prepared food section & juice bar.	1 star
	Selection of specialty and regular items is quite good. BUT, the layout, checkout and parking lots are literally the worst clusterfuck I've seen outside of New Delhi. Not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow.	1 star
	Wow, this store has greatly improved since I've been gone.  In ten years, it's turned into quite a nice store.  The variety of merchandise is great, although coming from the Midwest, I need to adjust to the price of food being higher.  The cashiers have been pretty friendly as well.	2 star
	I guess you pay for what you get...and in this case you get \"The Market District\" marque.  I don't have much time to write a full review so I'll just post one experience:  I went to this store to purchased smoked turkey necks and/or wings to make soup.  the small package was 11.00 dollars.  I don't remember the poundage, but I remember it was enough meat to make a pot of soup.\n\nI went to the Giant Eagle that was RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, and a similar package of smoked turkey was 3 bux.\n\n:-/	1 star
	Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.\n\nMain complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.	1 star
	Some people go crazy over this location, me, I just go crazy because of this location.\n\nI hate it, from the congestion in the parking lot to the congestion in every single aisle inside the store.  People are correct that this place has a larger selection of products, but forget your conventional set up for a grocery store.  You would think with this being a Market District.  It would be an easy endeavor.\n\nThis location is a place that I would visit for only one thing, definitely not a place I would regularly stop at, unless I lived within walking distance.	1 star
	They have a diverse variety of ethnic foods and is at a convenient location near UPMC Shadyside, but the customer service line is ALWAYS LONG and the employees working at the customer service always go SUPER SLOW!!	2 star
	My local grocery store.They just remodeled the cafe and dining area- looks beautiful and is spacious. They sell beer now. Also has a deli and cheese section. Gets crowded in the afternoons.	4 star
	The good: large selection. \nThe bad: the crazy high prices, missing price labels, inconvenient location. \nIt's come to the point that I avoid this place if I can. Aldi's is better for the basics and Pearl Market in the Strip district has better produce for 4x cheaper than this place.	1 star
	I much prefer shopping at Trader Joes, but I like the selection at Market District.  They carry some products I don't easily find anywhere else.  Parking is tricky, the parking lot is usually crammed and it's hard to find a spot.  Prices could be a lot better.  I don't care for their produce, I think they could do a lot to improve their produce.	2 star
	Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking.	0 star
	I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back.	0 star

	I mean, how many stars can you really give a laundromat? This place smells like mildew constantly.. Like, since I've been going, it's never NOT smelled like mildew. I'd like to think that a place you go to clean things..should be clean? Guess not. Anyway, the people who work here are courteous and nice, if that matters.	1 star
	I love coming in here!  It makes me feel like a kid again!  They have a lot of toys like Lego, Duplo (the big ones) and  checkers, bingo and chinese checkers!   Remember Mad-Libs?  This place has 'em!  \n\nIt's the closest thing to what our parents and grandparents used to call a dime store or \"5-and-dime\".  It's an older and more charming version of Family Dollar or something like that.	2 star
	Ditto on the Pizza heading. This is and alwasy will be a bar for me, not a pizza joint. I've enjoyed many shots, beers and games of darts. Low expectations makes this a fun fun place.	2 star
	Not quite dive bar, not quite trendy bar. This is a happy medium for many in the area. This place still has that neighborhood feeling but always pulls in new faces. Good spot to meet friends for a pitcher and perhaps a game of darts... maybe even a little photohunt.  Its a bar, so come here to drink, not to eat. Besides the drink prices are decent, so you can just have a liquid dinner.\n\n\nOne star because Doc is a super cool guy...\nOne star because of the outdoor patio in good weather...\nOne star because of the prices and location...	2 star
	I've gone here a few times and had o.k. service.  Nothing is ever impressive, i cant remember anything ive eaten here.. its forgettable :)... but the crowd is always friendly..  Last time the guy beside us gave us a pitcher of beer he ordered but couldn't drink ;)	2 star
	Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service.	1 star
	I've enjoyed Doc's Place for what it is - your average \"Bar\" - nothing spectacular but nothing excessively horrible.  They are very accomodating for throwing parties or events in their location so that's a huge plus.  I've had numerous events there and it's always turned out great.\n\nThe food is average and I don't pay much attention to the price of drinks b/c I'm usually with a large group and we take turns purchasing pitchers.  All in all this place is \"A-OK\".  As most people mentioned the deck is fun and its a great place for groups.	2 star
	Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer, when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open. They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks. It's nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work.\n\nThe beer selection isn't that great and the upstairs bar is not full. Sometimes their drink \"specials\" are served in tiny plastic cups. The service can also be rather slow.\n\nI am not a big fan of their food (pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked), although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people.	1 star
	Drinks are watered down\nHalf off burgers and pizza\nmakes it worth the trip.\n\n\n(b)	2 star
	The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMO\n\nWhen I booked the $53 pedicure, I was told\n(1) it would last an hour ,  and would\n(2) include  a foot massage   \n\nNot true:  the manicurist was done in 45 minutes.  and \nThe advertised  foot massage consisted of a quick rub of my feet and lower leg, finished in two minutes or less.  \n\nWhen the manicurist was done, I complained that\nmy feet were still rough.  \"You can't possibly expect your feet\nto be smooth after only one pedicure.\"\n\nExcuse me?  and why not?  Every other pedicure I've had\n(for much less money) got my feet smooth,	0 star
	Although this store has great employees, it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It is absolutely ghetto inside.  I don't think they've redone the store since the early 90s.  It's an embarrassment on Walnut.	1 star
	Friendly front desk. A little condescending toward the back. Lovely jewelry, extensive collection of lovely things. Well worth a visit for unique gifts.	3 star
	I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing.

	I've recently moved away from Pittsburgh, and Girasole is one of the places I miss the most. It's tiny and can be loud, but the food is amazing, the atmosphere is fantastic, and I can't wait to go back. I'd especially recommend the pumpkin ravioli, which appears on the menu in the fall. \n\nBecause it is small, it's well worth calling ahead for a reservation. Otherwise they will take your name and cell phone number, and you're free to wander around Shadyside until a table opens up.	4 star
	Cozy and comfortable, our food was really good, and the waitstaff friendly and efficient!\n\nThe mussels were great (garlic madness) and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen. wowowow.\n\nWill definitely try and revisit next time I'm in Pittsburgh.	3 star
	After my bad service experience at Girasole, the manager apologized and compensated me for my troubles. I would definitely go back, considering that the unfortunate situation I encountered was out of the norm for this usually friendly, cozy restaurant.	3 star
	Girasole is a great, little restaurant just off Walnut.  I love the cozy atmosphere and the decor.  I LOVE the salad and escarole & beans.  Perfect!  Vito, the owner/waiter is awesome.  They do a great job.  I think you can have parties there on Monday evenings (that take up the whole space), FYI.	4 star
	We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.\n  \nThe food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back.	1 star
	Very very nice small Italian restaurant . Seating is very limited but food and service are wonderful . My only small complaint is the price for a bottle of wine is a little pricey . They should make at least several bottles a bit more reasonable .	3 star
	Great place to get an authentic meal. Great wine selection with generous portions. The house dressing is to die for.	3 star
	My wife loves the gnocci.  It's a bit cramped so make sure you have reservations.  The menu is small but I've always found at least on dish to my liking, just never been blown away by anything yet.	2 star
	5 stars. 'Nuf said.	4 star
	Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud, we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back.	1 star
	Wow. The food here is to die for.\nI highly recommend this place; however, there are a few things you should be aware of. \nThis place is super small. It's always packed, so make a reservation. Because its so small, walking to and from your table can be a bit awkward as you try to avoid disturbing all the other patrons. The noise level is pretty high, too. Again, because of the close quarters.	3 star
	From the other reviews I really had high expectations for this Italian restaurant - was hoping for some authentic Italian food. Not the case. Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade. \n\nIt's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre, the service was very slow and the prices were high.	1 star
	Hard to get seating on Saturday and the noise level is high. Nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and good at what they do. The scallop appetizer and salads were good. I had issue with the pasta and you cant have issues with pasta in an italian restaurant.  The marinara sauce was too much tomato tasting acidic and lacked balance. The spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream, again not balanced. This place has all the elements of a good dining experience but the kitchen needs to up the game for my taste.	2 star
	Food here is out of this world good.  The venue is extremely charming too.  Service was a disappointment.  Couldn't help but get the feeling that we were annoying our waitress just by being patrons.  Speed was fine, food was great, but I don't like apologizing just because I chose to eat in your restaurant.	3 star
	Girasole is a great Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  The gnocchi is fantastic. They have a pretty broad italian wine list and great deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating.	4 star
	LOUD!\n\nWhen someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. \n\nService is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....\n\nHad the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa.	1 star

	Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle.	0 star
	Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!	4 star
	Girasole is a tiny, rustic Italian restaurant not unlike many places at which I've dined in Tuscany. The menu is simple, classic Italian cuisine and is recreated seasonally. The ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade. The only issue I have with the place is the owner. He is in charge of seating people and barked at us that there were no tables. We sat outside under the heater and enjoyed our meal there. He definitely put enough of a damper on the vibe of the place that I won't be returning. It simply isn't worth it.	2 star
	Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I don't ever post reviews but couldn't believe this place didn't have a higher rating.	4 star
	This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  They also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  The homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves.	4 star
	Summary: friendly neighborhood Peruvian eatery + gift shop. \n\nLa Feria occupies the floor above the Pamela's in Shadyside. It does not have a large foot-print, and half of it was devoted to the souvenirs.  This leaves little space for the dining venture. \n\nThe restaurant offers only a small menu, but the price is reasonable and the portion generous. For what you pay, the food tastes pretty good too. I do sort of wish that my empanadas were fresh out of an oven rather than a microwave.\n\n3.5 stars	2 star
	La Feria recently changed their menu, so I thought I'd post a review about their new system. \n\nThey've replaced the rotating daily specials with a larger menu. The classics are still on the menu (like the delicious ropa vieja) but now it's expanded to include things like their cheese and potato stew. \n\nAs you'd expect, everything is delicious. It's also worth noting that the service is quick and friendly and there's a whole section where you can shop/peruse Peruvian folk art and goods while you wait for your food. \n\nWhat can I say? I love La Feria.	4 star
	Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it.	1 star
	Not necessarily your traditional Peruvian food establishment, but the food is quite tasty and reasonably priced.  I had the empanadas (spicy beef and spinach & feta), they were quite good.  There are also at least 2 vegetarian dishes on special daily.  \n\nThey additionally have tonz of beautiful Peruvian art for sale here.  Not exactly the cheapest, but very fine craftmanship.  Definitely will be back.	2 star
	I've had pretty good dishes here. The flavors are varied and unique, and the fare is light and healthy. They offer a good variety of vegetarian options and lunch specials.\n\nI wish they didn't close so early. The atmosphere is also a little weird - its kind of like dining in a knitted-clothing store. Once you get past all of that, its a nice experience. Authentic? Who knows. I've yet to go to Peru. In the meantime, I'll keep enjoying the food they serve here.	3 star
	Went to La Feria for my first time today.  The setting is a bit odd with all of the crafts for sale, but it all works somehow.  The food was very average I thought.  The empandas were a plain, though my Ropa Vieja sandwich was pretty good.  The meat was tender and well cooked and the bread was fresh, it was just lacking a bit in the seasoning / flavor department.  \n\nI didn't dislike my meal, but I may look for other lunch options the next time I'm in Shadyside.	2 star
	I know this place doesn't have \"authentic\" food. I know it's not always the friendliest place. I know it looks weird, eating in the middle of a store. But for some reason their combination of a simple Dijon salad dressing and rice and always a decent slow cooked pulled chicken meal makes me enjoy solo lunches with a book. Once in a while you should skip the noisy, crowded, expected Pamela's and try something that tastes homemade.	3 star
	This place is amazing! First time here and it's a small place. Couldn't find it at first because its above Pamela's. needs a sign! \n\nAnyway, the food is incredible! I had the Triple Sandwich and it was WAY MORE than I expected. Taste is amazing. Sweet Potato chips were perfect. Definitely recommend it! :D	4 star
	This restaurant has a great concept! There were some menu items that would appeal to those who might not be comfortable ordering something \"Peruvian\" but that is balanced by other items that are more ground in Peruvian authenticity. I ordered the Pollo a la Bah\u00eda which was a special -- I was quite pleased with my meal.\n\nThe shop part of La Fer\u00eda had some great handmade Peruvian pieces that, although I didn't purchase now, I would be interested in going back in the future to buy.	3 star
	He's a good guy, always gets my things done on time.  I've had a less that satisfactory experience with other dry cleaners here--I'll vote with the majority and say, 'worth a visit.'  I've recommended him to many of my colleagues and friends.  All satisfied.\n\nWARNING:  Cash only--maybe checks.  No credit cards.	3 star
	They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job.	0 star
	They work quickly, but speed isn't worth it if the final product is damaged.	1 star
	Fantastic service! I needed to get my engagement ring sized down and saw the great reviews The Collection had and decided to give them a call. I had my ring resized in a matter of about an hour. It came back nicely cleaned and polished and finally fits! Kerry was so nice and professional and I felt like I could trust them. Love it, thanks!	4 star
	This is absolutely drunk food. For a $5 credit minimum you get 3 big crispy slices of plain pizza (for a rounded out $5). There's also a six pack to go that is pretty price but decent. The place, however, is really terrible looking and smelled kind of weird. It apparently has a very tiny bar too.\n\nAgain: good drunk food. Probably not good sober food.	2 star
	This place capped the night after getting hammerred in Shadyside 95% of the time.  It was pretty much guaranteed the drunken antics that would go down here would make you crack up.  The food was mediocre at best, but the old Indian dude that owned it (Pagoda as we all affectionately referred to him as) was worth the price of admission.  I downgraded it from 5 stars to 4 because his son sucks.	3 star
	Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave.  I will leave my review there!  BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.\n\nI was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'.	3 star
	I get the feeling Mozart has caused a few grumbles here and there due to strict rental agreement policies and such, but we've had nothing but a great experience living in one of their buildings. Every time we have a maintenance request, they get it done within 24 hours. The radiator heat is almost too strong. They're very courteous about letting us know when they need to get in the apartment. And to top it off, they redid our bathroom after we requested it.	3 star
	Absolutely horrible. My sink has been overflowing onto my countertops and ruining my belongings multiple times. Management did not even apologize for my inconvenience.	0 star
	My personal favorite Pittsburgh bar. Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks. For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home. Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then, mostly because I've also learned to never order more then two drinks. It's also tiny, so if you want to sit down, get there early (or go during the week). Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place.	4 star
	Stiff drinks, doubles priced like singles, a lounge (in the very best sense of the word) masquerading (appropriately enough) as a bar.  I wish I could turn down a heretofore unseen alley - or walk through a wardrobe - in Chicago and find myself sitting at the bar.	3 star
	Weird mix of local drunks and school crowd. Drink specials were nice. Had a pint of Brooklyn stout that was only $2.50. Pretty good deal compared to the Miller Light only type specials in other local bars. No tabs or credit cards, though. Isn't it 2010?	2 star
	Good luck getting out\nWith your soul and belongings.\nBring your own flashlight.\n\n\n(b)	1 star
	Nice atmosphere, way strong drinks, interesting music selection. I had a great time at Le Mardi Gras, and I left drunk and happy.\n\nMerci Beaucoup, mes amies!	3 star
	This is without a doubt the best alcoholic's bar in Shadyside. Smoking permitted. Extremely strong cocktails. The downside is that its a bit pricey but you are compensated well in alcohol. The bartenders are good people. Downsides: poorly lit - on weekends it can get a bit packed - so packed that you have to stand and in such a small space that's a bit uncomfortable.	4 star
	Really fun. Really packed on weekends. Inexpensive drinks. Also, available to order is a vodka drink made with fresh squeezed fruit.	2 star
	This place wasn't as lively as I expected. With a name like Le Mardi Gras, I was expecting an upbeat and friendly crowd. The ambiance was more like an after hours jazz club except they were playing American favorites instead of jazzy tunes.\n\nI think I had an atypical experience. I would return under the condition that there was a special event occurring.	2 star
	I moved to California ~2 years ago and miss Mardi Gras more than anything else. Richie and crew provided a home for all, the writers, designers, storytellers and more who found ourselves adrift and looking to share our story. Can't wait to get back one day.	4 star

	I love pams!	3 star
	Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only.	1 star
	kinda overrated because its like the only brunch place in the immediate area... wait is always long and food is pretty mediocre... plus shady side has really declined as a shopping district... BR has gone pretty useless now that its so expensive... who would pay $17 for a thin T-shirt made in malaysia?	2 star
	We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  \n\nTry DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead.	1 star
	Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit.	3 star
	Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \"I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\".	1 star
	Great portions, homey service, homey atmosphere, reasonable prices. Classic.	4 star
	Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding.	3 star
	The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times.	3 star
	Clean place.  Pancakes a bit too buttery for my taste (and health!).  But the vibe was good, and people were enjoying themselves, so I'd go back again - just wouldn't order the pancakes!	2 star
	New Yorkers.... if you like Clinton St. Bakery, this is Pittsburgh's answer. Their pancakes are the best I ever had. I had banana walnut once that was unbelievable. I am a sucker for corned beef hash and this was the best I've had as well. Really, this place is a national treasure.	4 star
	After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.\n\nThere's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner.	0 star
	Serve a good breakfast, but I only have the patience to go on weekdays (that aren't holidays, bc they are closed) bc it is mobbed on the weekends. Wish they were open past early afternoon, I would do breakfast for dinner there in a second (I imagine it wouldn't be so crowded).	2 star
	Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe.	1 star
	I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch, I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap, the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover, I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face.	1 star
	One of the best breakfasts ever. Awesome diner feel. Friendly service. Delicious corned beef hash. Addictive. And the best pancakes i've ever eaten - really unique and perfect texture. I wish i had a place like this near me. As good as it gets.	4 star
	How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can.	0 star
	If you Love Butter this is the place for you, it is yummy & delicious quick friendly service & the potatoes are tasty!\nNo credit cards this place is cash only	2 star
	Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for breakfast	3 star
	Blueberry pancakes were amazing	4 star
	A bit crowded, but amazing blueberry and strawberry pancakes. I fought to go here and waited about 20 mins for a table (weekend) but it was totally worth it.	3 star
	Excellent food. Great omelettes, great pan-cakes, everything is excellent!	4 star
	Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. \n\nThe space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?	1 star
	Ok! The best hash I have ever had. Their potatoes are \"bananas!\"	3 star
	Great place for brunch. I love the breakfast specials	3 star
	Cash only.\n\nThe 'famous' corn beef hash was not great- and heavily salted.  \n\nEggs were good.\n\nNot great food / not a lot of bang for the buck / 3.0 from me	2 star
	This place was great! We had several different dishes, but the chorizo hash was the winner. \n\nExpect a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.	3 star
	Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !	4 star
	There are 2 types of \"Good\" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck.	0 star
	We had to wait quite a bit for a table but once we got seated the food came out pretty fast. My friend and I ordered the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and Gail's famous eggs to share. The hotcakes were good as usual but I think it's over hyped. I didn't really like the eggs at all. It was creamier but it had this weird taste to it that I didn't like. We also got a side of bacon which was eh. We asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and that definitely makes them so much better!	2 star
	Pamela's is a staple and a classic to the Pittsburgh region. I've eaten at 3 locations: Oakland, Shadyside, and the Strip District. There's usually a line and no reservations, and they only take cash. I usually get the banana chocolate chip hotcakes, and sometimes will get just the chocolate chip hotcakes with whipped cream which are both equally delicious! The service is good as well, as they bring you waters the moment you sit down, and ultimately they are trying to get tables their food and ultimately get new customers in the door.	2 star
	I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance.	3 star
	This place has delicious, delicious food.  I love eating it so much.  \n\nOn the down side, it's really kind of a pain to get in there.  The lines are long, and the seating is not plentiful.  That's after you fight for parking.  \n\nAs tasty as the crepes are, I usually decide it isn't worth the bother and go somewhere else.	2 star
	I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.\n\nThe crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded.	3 star
	The best place for breakfast in Shadyside, especially if you don't feel like being drowned in food at Pamela's. There might be a wait, and don't try to go with more than two others (really, make it a date), but it's so clean and nice and relaxing. The crepes are excellent, I always get the breakfast crepe (sausage and egg) with their soytang sauce, but the dessert crepes (chocolate and orange! banana!) are also delicious. The little salad of greens and orange slices that comes with the savory crepes is a great addition. Go here when you're feeling cosmopolitan.	4 star
	Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes, but it's great to have the restaurant to fulfill crepe cravings :)	3 star
	The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. \n\nHowever, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.\n\nFinally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff.	1 star
	Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  \n\nThe place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).\n\nThey may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning.	3 star
	Love Crepes Parisiennes	4 star
	I really do enjoy stopping by the walnut location every week or so.  The French Breakfast tea with a savory crepe and salad is a great way to start a weekend.  While there's a huge list of crepes made-to-order, they're also willing to make you anything you can think of, as long as they have the ingredients.  Plus, it's underground, which just completes the aesthetic of a french crepe shop, where you sit amongst the sacks of flour to eat your crepe.	3 star
	Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???	1 star
	Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!	0 star
	Amazing crepes!\n\nMy wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes, my favorite has to be the Russian blintz and her's is the Nutella and banana.  I highly recommend getting a Cafe Au-Lait with your crepe.  \n\nNo complaints about this cozy little creperie.	4 star
	Boom! I love this place and I'm a 6'3\" man with an appetite! Every time people want to go I think great crepes and Ill be hungry right after I eat but damn I am wrong with this place.   Breakfast crepe is my choice but they all look amazing. This place fills up fast so get in line order and grab a table. EAT!	4 star
	Really delicious crepes! I come here all the time and I love it.  The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.\n\nThings to know before going: Cash only, order before sitting, and come during odd hours if you can.  It's a very busy establishment in a small location, but I normally go for late lunch on weekdays and have no problem at all getting a table right away or my food coming out quickly. I avoid Saturday mornings here.	4 star
	You guys...oh no, but I think this place was bought out! I walked by and saw a sign about ANOTHER waffle place coming soon. Ugh.\n\nThat being said, yeah, I love this place. I am such a fan of the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. God, so good. I can now say that having been to France, this place is pretty legit!\n\nMy only complaint is that I don't really get very full eating here. And it's kind of pricey for not getting you full. But whatever! Delicious. I really hope it's not closed.	3 star
	Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.\n\nNow he has the nerve to stay open.\nHate this place!	0 star
	I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:\n\nWelcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?\n\nYeah, I'd like a Frescuit. \n\nWe ain't got no hashbrowns!\n\n...um, all I want it a Frescuit. \n\nA'ight... I'm just lettin' you know.	1 star
	Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order.	0 star
	what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?	0 star
	This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find.	1 star
	The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \"chicken\" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate.	0 star
	Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me.	1 star
	For a quick, decent Chinese place in Shadyside, check out China Palace.  You get what you expect, it's fast and not too expensive.  I've only had delivery, but when I want Chinese food I've never had any surprises.\n\nAt the end of the day, you get what you pay for.  As for delivery in they area, it's decent enough.	2 star
	This place was \"OK,\" but I probably wouldn't go back. Food was kind of low end Chinese although service and atmosphere were fine. Not really bad, just not good either.	2 star
	We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there.	1 star
	I liked it.  Huge portions, not too expensive, and it's really nice inside.  I like my cheesy general tsos, what can I say.  It's not cuisine, but if you want a big fat plate of sweet and sour pork in a relaxed ambience it's great.\n\nI'm psyched that they deliver.	3 star
	General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... \n\nI am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!	1 star
	This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location, great veggie options. Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty.  Only 2 things that bother me, the hot and sour soup is TOO hot. I can't eat it. And it's not easy to find a parking space. Lots of driving around to find a spot. \nBut the restaurant is definitely worth checking out.	3 star
	This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?	1 star
	Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor, with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And, the food was ordinary.  Not bad, a little tasteless, but why bother?	1 star
	Good food.  They use good ingredients and present dishes well.  If they weren't in Shadyside, which peaked 40 years ago, they'd get the acclaim they deserve.	3 star
	The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.	0 star
	Very Good!\n\nGot the Beef Stew in Hot Pot. Pretty Spicy, but so delicious. \nHappy to have found this place on our stopover in Shadyside.	3 star
	Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty.	0 star
	Not crazy about this place. The food is subpar and definitely purchased in bulk and not the greatest quality. The atmosphere is clean and the staff is friendly so that's why I gave them a 3 star. \nGood luck.	2 star
	Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal.	1 star
	I had steamed chicken and veggies along with hot and sour soup! I would never get tired of it!	3 star
	LOVE this place! Super-friendly staff. Soy protein with broccoli was suh. Flippin. Good. I was with 2 meat-eaters that loved it too. Go to their website for full menu --I don't see it here on Yelp, but we got it 2 days ago.\n\nReviewer below is right--menu wording is a little confusing. The vegetable/tofu dishes are not necessarily vegetarian. But the vegetarian dishes are (duh). So are some of the other things (noodles, appetizers, etc.)\n\nTo summarize: It's good. Go!	3 star
	Tyipical \"Chinese restaurant\" menu and flavour. Environment and service is above average, making overall experience decent.	2 star
	My Pittsburgh friend says that this is her fave store.  Well, as far as high fashion goes, this is it for Pittsburgh.  Tiny selection of some higher end designers, Dolce and Gabbana, Lanvin, Tory Burch....a small selection of shoes (even some Prada).  A selection of nice jewelry and a good selection of knits.  They had one of my fave knitwear company's, Inhabit .  A bigger selection than I had seen anywhere.  I bought a few of those, so I guess it is my fave store in Pittsburgh, too.	2 star
	Not really for females under 45.	1 star
	So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?	0 star
	Gary is great with coloring (blonde). It's a cool, laid back little salon.	4 star
	Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick, curly hair and he makes cutting and styling it look effortless. Super talented stylist who is always great fun to talk to! \n\nEveryone at Salon Cercone are really nice, and the environment is welcoming and casual. It's definitely a great place for the more laid back salon goers.	4 star
	Very nice inventory, as others have said. The company has been, however, very slow in resizing jewelry items purchased at the store, and failed to meet promised deadlines in performing resizing.	2 star
	2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but, ill see what the end product will be once I was receive it. If it approves I will change my rating	1 star
	I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price.	1 star
	I've had pretty good experiences dining here, but maybe that's because other people were paying for my food about half of those times.  The service was fine, and I liked the decor.  I also enjoyed the food, although if I recall correctly, there was entirely too much of it.\n\nAs a carless resident of Pittsburgh, I love the great location on Walnut Street.  I don't have to go out of my way to dine here, since there are plenty of stores to visit.	3 star
	Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.\n\nService, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet.	0 star
	How to review the Walnut Grill?--a place that served us quality food on a standard menu, but at prices where some imagination would have gone a long way, especially since we paid a lot for it? (Mango salsa, I'm looking at you.) Some of our favorites: the spinach artichoke dip, the pork cheeks, the filet. \n\nThis particular dining experience was also the first time ever a server has ever, with the gravest of grave faces, relayed to us that the kitchen was out of broccoli. Also the first time I giggled at a server. If you're out there: I'm sorry!	2 star
	Too pricey for the quality.	1 star
	This place has cockroaches.\nPeople throw up in the booths.\nPretty good white russian.\n\n(b)	1 star
	This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back.	0 star
	The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about.	4 star
	Best Chinese food!!! Good delivery service, just love it!	4 star
	BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the \"We Are Responsible\" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless.	0 star
	It's pizza, and my family prefers Pizza Company over the big chains, and other local places. We used to order from the Potomac location, since they delivered to our address, but since they've closed, the Library Rd. store is our go to shop. \nThe wings, and breadsticks have been given a thumbs up by the kids. Pizza has been consistent, whether we're ordering a cheese pizza, or something with extra toppings like pepperoni, or Italian sausage. Service is friendly, food is good, the only drawback is having to drive Rt. 88.	2 star
	This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years, and this is a solid non-chain joint.  The sandwiches are fantastic. Probably skip the wings or anything fried, to be honest though.  Cheesebread is fantastic.\n\nIt's WELL worth a try folks.	4 star
	I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location, the staff is friendly, and the clothing always looks great. My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time.	2 star
	Graham's is tucked away among a few other stores that I rarely ever visit. The few times I have gone to Graham's the folks have always been very nice and have introduced me to a few different fatty and sugary treats that we all crave now and again. Each product I have had has always been tasty and fresh. I will come back once I work off the extra calories from my most recent visit.	3 star
	Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back.	0 star
	My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh!  Best Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy!  Service is the best part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers.  They do it all and do it well. Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap. Freshly made everything (except the classic fortune cookie in the plastic wrapper and wouldn't have it any other way!). Great Oolong tea with every meal!	4 star
	Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention.	0 star
	Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.\n\nWe could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...\n\n:D	1 star
	They do an okay job, but I find this place is VERY expensive and while they do an ok job, they don't do a great job.  You can find the same or better manicure near by, for half the price.	1 star
	Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon.	0 star
	Had dinner here the other night and it was lovely. The dragon phoenix soup was amazing, the service was wonderful, we'll definitely be going back.	3 star
	If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.  \n\nWater is cold, so that's a plus.	0 star
	Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say.	0 star
	Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles.	1 star
	Probably 3.5 stars.\n\nFood allergy friendly with a lot of choices. Prices are fair with large portions.\n\nThe greek vinaigrette with feta was really good. The food was fine for a casual meal--no complaints. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive, and really went out of her way to work with the gluten allergy at the table.\n\nNothing special, but still a more than acceptable place for dinner.	2 star
	Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good	0 star
	Best Italian hoagies you can get	4 star
	Some of the best pizza I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. And they have good hoagies as well.	3 star
	Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie.	4 star
	Awesome place for a working guy to get boots and work clothes esp Carhart stuff ....I have gotten a few pairs of boots here and also got a pair of boots resoled here and it was worth every penny	4 star
	I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.	3 star
	I was on vacation in Pittsburgh and had a muffler problem. Penn Automotive took a look, told me what I needed, but was unable to fix it that day due to scheduled customers. They also told me it was safe to drive, just loud and annoying. They didn't charge anything. I told them I couldn't give them repeat business since I was from out of town, but would surely give them a good review. If I did live in in the area I would be a regular customer. Thanks again	4 star
	The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.	0 star
	We like this supermarket - close, convenient, and actually well-stocked! Seafood and meats are fresh, and for a supermarket, it actually has a fair amount of specialty items.  Fruits and vegetables are of excellent quality, and they have a large organic section, which is nice. Probably the biggest \"perk,\" however, is the fuel discount you get at GetGo. That, and the quality food keeps us coming back for more!	3 star
	Fast friendly service and good sandwiches. This is a neighborhood staple that deserves your business.	4 star
	Amazing food. You can stuff your face to the point you hate yourself for $10.00. The shoe string fries are amazing and the subs are made fresh right in front you! I love the casual and down to earth environment. One of my favorite places to eat in the entire city!  The cash only policy isn't ideal and the .50 cent refills I don't agree with but an ATM isn't far if need be! My advice? Eat here! It's delicious.	4 star
	This has always been my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food is consistently very good - General Tso's is tender, not the shoe leather I sometimes get at other places. Steamed dumplings, wonton soup, lo-mein, all terrific.	4 star
	I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road.	0 star
	I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \"okay.\"  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it?	1 star
	Most dishes on the menu are American style Chinese food. Not a bad choice if you just want to have a quick bite at lunch time. I felt that the food there is a little pricier than it should be. Aside from these I do recommend their basil chicken, which is a traditional Taiwanese dish.	2 star
	Food was very bland, i even asked that they kick it up a notch.  I traveled to this area from Northern Virginia.  I never had such bland Chinese food in all my travels.  I have had worse, the Scallops and Shrimp were fresh, the rice was cooked well.  Went here after my Brothers raved about it...	1 star
	I took a high end designer purse to be fixed here! It turned out better tan expected! The fixed the strap without any hint of repair! They do a great job on shoes! Great place to do business!	4 star
	Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no?	1 star
	Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!	4 star
	Excellent food with great service.	3 star
	Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away, my fellow gluten intolerants and celiacs!	4 star
	Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable.	1 star
	This is my first Thai food restaurant I have eaten at in Pittsburgh and I love it! The Tom kha soup with vegetables is delicious and so is the butternut squash curry. The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!	4 star
	Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!	1 star
	Really good Thai food.  Very friendly service and management.  Food is prepared promptly and is consistently good.  I wish that they DELIVERED!!  We eat their food often.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired, though.	3 star
	Love the staff and LOVE the thai pad.  Yummy!	3 star
	I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums, but also for 5 years of drum lessons. They have great staff who are all very knowledgeable about the gear they sell and I have yet to find better prices in any other music store. They treat customers like friends but they don't try to \"sell\" you things the way the big corporate stores do. If you need any kind of music gear, but it at N' Stuff Music.	4 star
	By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well ! A must to come by too!	4 star
	The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good.	0 star
	Food is bar food nothing great. But it is a good time. Karaoke was fun if you know your songs from the 70s and 80s. Fun crowd that just wants to sing and drink no drama	3 star
	This little smokey hole in the wall is a really cool spot.  The decorations are what bring everyone here.  Every inch is covered and it is something to be seen.  If you are in the area at Christmas time it shouldn't be missed.	3 star
	Hard drinking local crowd. Simple pub food. Friendly and relaxed local bar with a holiday by holiday light show extravaganza.  Unfortunately experience marred by intense smoke. After an hour there hair and clothes, reek of cigarettes.  Had to leave because my eyes were burning. Ive been there before and it never seemed this bad. I thought all restaurants were supposed to be smoke free?	2 star
	love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere, even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks weren't like Applebee's :)\n\nthe only No at this place was, I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Mold;\n\nbut other than that I love theirr Stakes :)	3 star

	Big hotel. Not bad. Bathrooms way too small I had to dry off outside the bathroom. Priceline for good rate.	1 star
	Stayed here overnight and wished we realized how busy of a hotel this place was before checking in. We stayed over a weekend in the summer and upon check in, the lobby was packed with 2 large confereces going on. Not enough parking to accomadate the lounge crowd on Saturday night and hotel guests. We returned back to the hotel after dinner and couldn't find a parking place. Also, next time I am offered a room with a sleep number bed, I will definately pass.	1 star
	Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.	1 star
	Pros: great place to host a event or special occasion, awesome cookies, clean, room service food good, and great price for a double tree 4 miles from downtown. \nCons: loud A/C bathrooms small, countertops low, outdated, bathtub needs changing	2 star
	Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up, I called Front desk, they told me be patient.  I waited and called them again around 1:30pm, they hang up my phone after I explained the purpose of the phone call. I called them third time around 1:35pm, no response.  Hope they will improve quality of their service.	1 star
	My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!	4 star
	This place is pretty good.  The staff is pretty knowledgeable and helpful depending on who is working.  \n\nThey are priced competitively with online resources, but the product is readily available.\n\nWhat I do not like is that everything comes prepackaged.  My old HBS in Boston allowed us to measure out our grains and hops to meet the needs of the recipe.\n\nAs I get to know the place better I am sure I will give some better reviews.	2 star
	Perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. His Gen. Tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food.	1 star
	New digs are nice!  Service was solid.  Food was solid.	2 star
	I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. \nI took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.\nJohn (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.\nWe are now going to sue him for damages.	0 star
	Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!	0 star
	3x. So far so good.	3 star
	I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!	0 star
	All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway.	0 star
	Smells\n\nGood service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a \"needs cleaning\" public bathroom tinge to it as well. \n\nYou'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.\n\nIt's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement.	1 star
	Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be!	2 star

	I have been going to this restaraunt for years. The service is great but the food is subpar at best. The salad bar has fake cheese and imitation bacon bits. The fish is ok, sometimes a little overcooked. My husband is a fan of the green shrimp. The hushpuppies however are delicious!	2 star
	The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here.	0 star
	Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend.	0 star
	i haven't stepped foot inside yet, but we picked up some food last week.

	Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing.	0 star
	Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \"give me 20 minutes\" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing.	0 star
	really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/\nWish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it.	0 star
	food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross...	1 star
	Cheap bowling, clean, serves food, & has pool tables. What else could you ask for in a bowling alley?	4 star
	Just your typical small town post office. Service is always pretty quick & the lines aren't entirely too long. They have all your mailing needs along with post office boxes as well. So nothing special, just your typical post office.	2 star
	This place is pretty good at getting the orders out quickly and most importantly getting everything you order in the bag. I did get the splats after eating here the last time but I can't be 100% sure it was from this food here, but it doesn't matter I will still keep going.	3 star
	I appreciate how clean it is here and that's probably because they have a lot of employees. Despite all of help, I still waited so long for an iced mocha that I ate all of my fries while standing at the cash register.\n\nKudos to major employers in small, rural areas!	2 star

	12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.\n\n1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.	0 star
	Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time.	0 star
	Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here.	0 star
	My wife surprised me with a Living Social deal.  We went as a couple.  We had a blast!  Nice of them to run a LS deal.  \n\nSince I have been there last (5 yrs), they have gone away from hunting and are almost 100% tactical.  So many toys, so little time.	2 star
	Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!	1 star
	Bar food\nDecent bar food though.\nWaitress was nice\nBeer was cold \nCool paintings and art\nAtmosphere was warm and non pretentious	3 star
	Here for trivia night on Tuesday night. Love me some Christina but they are way under staffed. It took almost an hour to get out food. Good food but this is ridiculous.  We had to go to the bar to order drinks. They need to get some help in here or people will stop coming!	1 star
	I'm not one to complain, and I am not a picky eater, but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it, I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes, which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food.	0 star
	Great nail spot in the northlake area - they recognize their returning customers, and are very friendly.  Competitively priced in comparison to Nail Saloons in the mall.	2 star
	we are members sines 2010 and we are very happy with the classes and the gym,\nlast weekend we wanted to do our son 6th birthday,the room was set up great  but when we needed help with more napkins , cups  and juice for the kids they run out and i had to go out and leave to the store in the middle of   my sons birthday,and above that they tried to charge us for 2 more cups that we needed .\ni will stay a member of the gym but no more birthdays.	2 star
	As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .	1 star
	Stopped here while visiting from out of town on a clear chilly day. It was Beautiful and the snow covered ground was neat! It appears to have some history here along with a lake, raptor museum etc and other things we didn't get to explore.	2 star
	I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times.	3 star
	Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it	3 star
	This was a fun little side mention on our trip along the eastern seaboard.\nI absolutely love history and although not the best historical point on our trip, it was cute seeing the old farm house and the animals.\nmy favorite were the pigs, even though i was bitten by one of them.	2 star
	This place is great for the whole family. Admission was $8.00 because they were having a special holiday program. The grounds were just like it was back in the 1800's. The houses and cabins are in excellent shape. The gift shop was nice and the civil reenactment was nice to watch. This place is perfect for a great history lesson.	4 star
	I attended the evening flashlight maze on Saturday evening. Bring your own flash light. It was a ton of fun and the maze really lives up to it's name. This year's maze was made into a baseball theme. \n\nThe orientation is crucial for tips and hints on getting through the maze. The staff is also helpful during your trek through the maze. Don't be afraid to ask others for help. \n\nThey also had a variety of fair food (funnel cakes, fried oreos, corn dogs etc) available for purchase. \n\nI highly recommend for a night of fall fun!	3 star
	I took my kids here one afternoon when my wife was out of town on business, and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun we all had. Lots of great birds, from condors to bald eagles, in a beautiful wooded setting. There's also a very cool playground in the middle that my kids almost found more interesting than the raptors. A fun outdoor experience that also serves an important purpose.	2 star
	Pricey,but worth it in an emergncy.	3 star
	On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place.	0 star
	This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over.	1 star
	Very good pizza!  This is usually our \"go to\" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side.	3 star
	If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!	1 star
	This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!	0 star
	Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.\n\nJust awful.	0 star
	UGH.\n\nNasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. \n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was \"stopped up\" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis place is filthy. \n\nThe food is atrocious.\n\nThe employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).\n\nYour pal,\nWalter	0 star
	I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for)\nBut as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all.\nWe have gotten to know the crew, don't know if that helps, but everything is fresh, hot, and never a messed up order. \nThe burger buns even look like the commercial and not squished!!\nOverall good experience, will return for sure.	2 star
	We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else.	4 star
	We appreciate so very much the honesty, integrity, and prompt and efficient service provided by Custom Comfort Heating & Air of Matthews, NC.  Custom Comfort has serviced our home for over ten years.  This company provides wonderful service to their customers.  The company operates with ethics and integrity.  You can trust this company and be assured of their best with every service call!	4 star
	Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back	0 star
	Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste.	1 star
	It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again.	0 star
	Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.	0 star
	Everything was great except that the water in the shower WOULD NOT heat up, ever, rendering it unusable. I ended up taking a sponge bath with the aid of the sink. \nTo be fair we didn't tell the staff because it was late at night and weren't too keen on switching rooms or having some maintenance guy come up.	3 star
	I didn't wake up as a doctor.	2 star
	Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded.	0 star
	Great food! awesome Margaritas!	4 star
	Got carnitas.. good food, large portions.. service was o.k.  I wish it was more authentic.. I'm use to L.A. authentic mexican food..  looking for homemade salsa, mexican cheese and handmade tortillas!!	2 star
	Great BBQ plate, amazing slaw on burger. So glad I found this place right near my house.	4 star
	For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))	3 star
	Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland.	0 star
	I've been to it a few times over the years, and I've never had a major issue with this store. I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty. If in the area and hungry, I would return.	2 star
	Went right after lunch rush so it was a little messy, however the manager in charge was great.  Yes, they did forget my kids milk and toys, but gave it to me and apologized. I'm not a huge mc d's fan bcuz of health reasons, so I gave it a 3 but service was a 4.	2 star
	I arrived late-ish, tired from a grueling trip and emotionally bruised from an encounter with a rental car company, and immediately I was in good hands. Kind and friendly front desk people took care of me, going the extra mile. Beautiful lobby, excellent room (impeccably clean), great wings at the bar (open late!), patient servers, and just an overall feeling of comfort and wellbeing.  Lovely bed, hot shower, in-room coffee pot, freshly renovated...go stay there. I would. \n\nHighly recommend. Only faint issue:  would have loved free wi-fi. Not a deal-breaker, though. I like Starwood Hotels, of which this is one.	4 star
	Perfect airport hotel.  Decent rooms, starting to age but still not bad.  Not easy to get to or find so look for the large gas sign. But if you do, they have a small pool and a large lobby.  Perfect place to hang out if your tired of your small room.  Food is okay but nothing fantastic in my three stays there.	2 star
	Not bad.  Large and tasteful lobby, small but fun indoor/outdoor pool and seating area.  Rooms were nicely appointed and everything seemed clean and in order.  The staff was very friendly and the free airport shuttle kept to its schedule (every 30 mins).  However, there is nothing around except a Shell gas station.  No restaurants or bars except the hotel ones (which close at 12am).	2 star
	The lobby is nice and the pool, fitness room are good. Some floors look a bit dated although rooms are just like other Sheratons.	3 star
	For whatever reason, I do not end up shopping at Belk all that often, but when I have ended up there (or here, at any rate), I have to agree with Tracy - I end up wandering pretty aimlessly and generally do not end up finding much.\n\nI have always associated Belk with a higher quality of merchandise, and while they do have some good selections on particular items (the number of bowties they have in particular is unbelievable), it is thrown about pretty haphazardly. Not terribly conducive to be able to helping you on your way.	2 star
	Belk at Carolina Place always has amazing customer service. They often compensate when you forget a coupon at the register.	2 star
	This is my favorite wing place.  The owners are really nice and they are very accomodating if you have any special instructions for your wings.  Lots of flavor combinations.  This is a place where you want to place your order to go.   I suggest the Red Tang flavor.  Yum !!  They are also now doing Pizza although I've never tried it.\n\nhttp://tlcwingsandgrill.com/	3 star
	I love these wings!!!\n\nThere are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like, Hot, Barbecue, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Spicy Garlic Parmesan and I have not been disappointed yet! \n\nEach wing is juicy and full of flavor, they are always hot and made to order ..SOOOO amazing! \n\nYes...they have more than just wings....like pizza, subs and fries...but I've only had the wings AND trust me YOU are going to want to try these wings...again and again!!!\n\nIn my opinion, these are the best wings in town!	4 star
	I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \"that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. \" When I spoke to the \"manager\" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there.	0 star
	I used to love this place for the wins and the staff. But I'm not sure if they sold or just changed staff around, but the wings are still great the service as far customer service and management can be worked on.\n\nTips:Cajun ranch and calypso are great even on the tenders. And the fried mushrooms are awesome. Don't waste your time not  the pizza though	2 star
	Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back.	0 star
	I don't understand the super low reviews on here, eat here quite often, it's delicious, and fresh, they cook to order.  For mall Asian-style food, you can't beat it!	3 star
	Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!	0 star
	I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for, $3.99.  Went back to exchange them for better quality ones without my receipt, they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?	0 star
	Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge.	1 star
	Convenient to Carowinds theme park, and excellent hot breakfast.\n\nWe stayed here for a cheap hotel for the whole family & were very happy with the experience. The free breakfast was delicious (biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, eggs, waffles, yogurt, milk, juice, cereal, pastries, muffins, bagels, oatmeal). The pool was nice too, and they have extra towels by the pool so you don'th ave to use the room towels.\n\nNot a super fancy hotel, but it was a good value and convenient location, lots of restaurants nearby.	2 star
	Very dated, small bathroom, tube TV\n\nBreakfast was good.	1 star
	Went to buy boots for the girls. Pretty uneventful. Looks like the cast from any Disney show stocked the entire place. Staff was nice and helpful. The girls jumped up and down at every glittery thing they saw. Oh, and \"can I get this, daddy?\" was the question of the day followed by the official response of the day, \"HELL NO!\" by me.\n\nOh wait, you mean this is the same exact review for http://www.yelp.com/biz/p-s-from-aeropostale-pineville#hrid:8cycFTIbYWZ9X9z841mq_g/src:self	2 star
	They've got boys' clothes.  They've got girls' clothes.	2 star
	It is a good alternative to BassPro and a much shorter drive for me. The selections are a bit limited but for the most part I can find what I need. Since they have renovated the store their hunting supplies have increased a little but would like to see a bit more.	2 star
	Thank you everyone who posted reviews. Due to the information I have now researched, I will not be attending this store ever. I will be driving to another dicks location bc clearly this one seems to be one hot mess.	1 star
	Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up.	1 star
	This is where the birthday girl wanted to go last night so this is where we went.\n\nBest surprise - a free slice of Black Forest cake with the purchase of any two dinner entrees.  This is the Tuesday special and it's large enough for two to share.\n\nTable ordered the wienerschnitzel, sauerbrauten and chicken nadia.  Three entrees, two glasses of wine, one large draft beer, a cup of coffee and the free Black Forest cake ran $80 including tip.	2 star
	Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great, especially the pretzel rolls you get.  The beer selection is vast.\n\nOktoberfest is a great time as well. A polka band plays while you eat and enjoy authentic German food.	4 star
	Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better.	1 star
	solid place.  excellent beer selection.  food is very good. prices are decent.	3 star
	Went there for lunch not overly crowded but there was no hostess,  after about 5 minutes a waitress came and seated us.  \n\nHad the bratwurst sandwich on a pretzel hoagie with fries.  It was ok nothing special.  Our waitress was slow and never came to give is refills. \n\nI'd  give it another try   But it was just ok.  I could get the same sandwich at Jason's deli	2 star
	Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing.	0 star
	OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome, in so many ways. First the atmosphere was perfect. A very casual feel. There's a bar that you can walk up to sit down order a great pint of beer. Second the waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable. Third the food all my God is so good.  The portion sizes are great. We will be going back definitely.	4 star
	ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year.	3 star
	Wunderbar! Authentic! Eleven German draft beers. The server( Stefanie) was from Dresden and did a great job. Sauerbraten, spatzle, and rot kohl were great!	4 star
	Went with a large group. Fast service, great service! The pretzel rolls are delish! I ordered the house side salad and the lighter appetite marinated beef slices. It was a delicious, German meal. Would highly recommend if UR a German or if you love German dishes	3 star
	Everytime I'm in the area I stop here.  Great selection of German Beers.  Staff could not be more welcoming and friendly.  Schnitzel, red cabbage, potato pancakes are excellent.  If you are not filled by the end of the meal the black forest cake is a can't miss.	4 star
	You don't see German restaurants very often and I'm glad I ran into this one for lunch. To begin, great atmosphere and stellar service. And because it's a German spot, I had to order the Wiener Schnitzel. I'm glad I did because it was fantastic. It's been a while since I've had breaded veal, but to say I was satisfied would be an understatement.	4 star
